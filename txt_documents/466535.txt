Applicability  
All research and related activities  involving human subjects for which ASU is a responsible participant, regardless of 
funding source(s), including questionnaires, interviews, and secondary data used in research activities  
 
Policy  
Research involving human subjects  is an important and necessary activity of the university and must be conducted in an 
ethical manner.  ASU complies with the ethical principles set forth by the National Commission for the Protection of 
Human Subject s of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in its report entitled The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and 
Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research.  In addition, ASU has negotiated a federal -wide assurance  
with the Office for Human Research Protections and U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services, assuring that ASU 
will comply with federal regulations concerning research involving human subjects regardless of the sourc e of funding 
for a project.  
 
Before any research project involving human subjects can be started and conducted at ASU, it must be submitted for 
review to the ASU Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (IRB) . When sponsors require IRB approval as part of the 
applications process, the approval must be received and documented within the Enterprise Research Administration 
System (ERA) before the proposal is submitted to the sponso r.
