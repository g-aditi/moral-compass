Guiding Principles  \n \nThe board and the universities value and desire to develop their relationships \nwith sovereign tribes. This policy reflects the board’s commitment to these \nimportant government -to-government relationships by recognizing and affirming \nfundamental principles of consultation and respect.  \n \n1. The board recognizes and respects the authority of sovereign tribes and is \ncommitted to government -to-government relationships with individual \nsovereign tribes.  \n \n2. The board and the universities respect and acknowledge th e culture, \ntraditions, beliefs, governance processes, tribal laws, codes, regulations, \nand protocols of sovereign tribes. As such, the board and the universities \nare committed to complying with all applicable tribal laws, codes, and \nregulations.  \n \n3. This p olicy sets forth the requirements and expectations for good faith \nconsultation between the board and universities and tribal leaders and \ndesignated representatives.  \n \n4. The expectations described in this policy are in support of, and not \nintended to limit, the many successful on -going relationships and \ncollaborations between the board, the universities and tribes. The board \nencourages on -going communication with tribal le adership regarding this \nconsultation policy as well as other issues of mutual interest, such as \nstudent success.  \n \nB. Consultation  \n \n1. Expected and required consultation  \n \na. The board and universities will communicate early, regularly, and in \ngood faith wi th individual tribal governments regarding proposed \nresearch, initiatives, agreements, and policies that may have \nforeseeable implications for tribes and individuals as members of a \ntribe.  \n ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS  Effective: 9/27/2018  \nPolicy 1-118, Tribal Consultation   \n \nChapter I: General Provisions   Page 2 of 5 \nArticle A: General Provisions  \n b. The board acknowledges that laws that protect individual \nparticipants in research may not be sufficient to protect the interests \nof a sovereign tribe that could be affected by research.  \n \nc. Universities and tribes will collaborate in the design of research in \nwhich they jointly choose to participate. Each party to t he joint \nresearch will consult with all other parties regarding confidentiality, \nownership of data and results, use of land or other resources, \nownership and disposition of any biological materials collected in \nthe course of research, proposed changes in t he research, and \nproposed publications or presentations relating to the research. \nEach party will strive to communicate in a manner that is \nreasonably understandable by all parties.  \n \nd. The following are examples of possible activities by universities \nunde r the governance of the Arizona Board of Regents with the \npotential for direct tribal implications that will require consultation \nunder this policy:  \n \ni. Any research supported or authorized by a university under \nthe governance of the Arizona Board of Regents, that \ninvolves participation by members of a sovereign tribe and \nthat may foreseeably result in research results with \nimplications specific to a tribe or to individuals as members \nof a tribe, and the proposed publication or dissemination of \nthat re search;  \n \nii. Any research involving human subjects, including genetic \ntesting or testing of blood, tissue or other biological materials \nin which the individual’s membership in or affiliation with a \ntribe is identified, and that is intended to or that may \nforeseeably result in conclusions or generalizations about a \ntribe or individuals as members of a tribe;  \n \niii. Any research or other activity involving human remains, \nfunerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural \npatrimony that are subject to the  Native American Graves \nProtection and  Repatriation Act; \n \niv. Any activity, including research, on land under the control or \njurisdiction of a sovereign tribe;  \n \nv. Any initiative, including educational programs, intended for \nstudents or employees who are members of or affiliated with \nfederally recognized tribes; and  \n ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS  Effective: 9/27/2018  \nPolicy 1-118, Tribal Consultation   \n \nChapter I: General Provisions   Page 3 of 5 \nArticle A: General Provisions  \n vi. Any board or A rizona public university policy or initiative that \nmay foreseeably affect a sovereign tribe in a manner \ndifferent than the general public.  \n \n2. Board and university tribal lia isons  \n \na. The board executive director  will serve as the tribal liaison for the \nboard.   \n \nb. Each university president will designate a tribal liaison for the \nuniversity.  \n \n3. Consultation Process  \n \na. If the board or a university plans to develop a policy or propose an \ninitiative or practice that will affect any federally recognized tribe in \nArizona, the board and university tribal liaison(s) will use their best \nefforts to share information and solicit input in advance about the \nproposed policy or initiative with the affected tribes. The universities \nmay from time to time develop new programs and services or \ndiscontinue existing programs or services for Native American \nstudents, and will involve the univ ersity’s designated tribal liaisons \nto assist in communicating those changes.  \n \nb. When consulting with or seeking consent from a sovereign tribe for \npurposes of research, land use or other agreements, university \ninstitutional review boards and contracting  departments must \ndocument proof of tribal consultation and approval in accordance \nwith the applicable protocol or process of the tribe(s) involved. The \nuniversity’s tribal liaison should be advised of the project and will \nassist in identifying the appropr iate leaders and approval protocols \nof the tribe(s).  \n \nc. Consultation with pan -tribal or non -governmental organizations \n(e.g., the Intertribal Council of Arizona, the Arizona Commission on \nIndian Affairs, Urban Indian Centers, etc.) and committees (e.g., \nUniversity Tribal Advisory Councils, etc.) Will be in coordination \nwith, and not to the exclusion of, consultation with individual \nsovereign tribes.  \n \n4. This policy is not intended to address matters such as tuition setting and \nother general issues that af fect tribal members or communities to the \nsame extent as the general public.  \n \n \n ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS  Effective: 9/27/2018  \nPolicy 1-118, Tribal Consultation   \n \nChapter I: General Provisions   Page 4 of 5 \nArticle A: General Provisions  \n C. Education  \n \nEach university will establish educational programs for university administrators, \nfaculty, staff, and students regarding the requirements and expectations for tribal \nconsultation and research.  \n \nD. Resolution of issues and enforcement  \n \n1. Any concerns related to tribal consultation should be brought to the \nattention of the appropriate university tribal liaison for assistance in \nresolving.  The tribal liaison will  coordinate with appropriate university \npersonnel and use best efforts to work with the designated \nrepresentative(s) of the tribe(s) and other affected individuals to reach a \nmutually acceptable resolution.  \n \n2. If the tribal liaisons and designated repres entatives are not able to \ncollaboratively develop a satisfactory and timely resolution, the university \ntribal liaison will inform the university president, who will offer to meet with \nthe designated leadership of the tribe to continue to address the concer ns. \nThe university president will include the board executive director  as \nappropriate.  \n \n3. Upon learning of any allegations of violations of research protocols, \nresearch policies, land use or access agreements with a sovereign tribe, \nor laws or policies of  a sovereign tribe, the involved university personnel \nwill promptly advise their university tribal liaison and university president. \nThe university president or the president’s designee will assist in notifying \nthe affected tribe.  \n \n4. The board and univers ity will address allegations of violations of board or \nuniversity rules by university employees or students through personnel \npolicies, codes of conduct and policies on research compliance and \nintegrity.  \n \n5. Activities contemplated under this policy may a lso be subject to applicable \ntribal law, state and federal law, including codes, ordinances, research \nand other protocols and regulations.  \n \n \n \nPolicy History  \n12/4/2008   Approved by the Board on second reading.  \n2/5/2016  Policy revision approved by the Board  on second reading.  \n9/27/2018  Policy was revised  to reflect “Executive Director” of the Board in place of ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS  Effective: 9/27/2018  \nPolicy 1-118, Tribal Consultation   \n \nChapter I: General Provisions   Page 5 of 5 \nArticle A: General Provisions  \n “President.”  \nRelated Information  \n "

To What Does This Policy Apply? Scope and\nApplicability of the Regulations\n \n§__.101(a) IRBs Not Operated by an Institution\nHolding a Federalwide Assurance\nNew language at §__.101(a) is adopted that gives Common Rule departments and\nagencies the authority to enforce compliance directly against IRBs that are not\noperated by an assured institution. This authority will allow Common Rule\ndepartments and agencies to avoid involving other engaged institutions in\nenforcement activities related to the responsibilities of the designated IRB. It is\nanticipated that this change will reassure institutions using an IRB that they do\nnot operate because compliance actions could be taken directly against the IRB\nresponsible for the regulatory noncompliance, rather than against the institutions\nthat relied on that review.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

The\nfinal rule reverts to the general structure of the pre-2018 rule and integrates some\nof the categories proposed for exclusion in the NPRM into that structure. Some\nchanges to the categories are also included in the final rule.\nIn the final rule, some of the proposed exclusions from the requirements of the\nCommon Rule are addressed in the definition of research, which includes a\nprovision identifying “activities that are deemed not to be research” (see Section\nIII [of the revised Common Rule preamble]). In addition, some of the proposed\nexclusions are included as exemptions in the final rule. Under §__.101(b) of the\npre-2018 rule, six categories of research were considered exempt from this policy\nunless otherwise required by department or agency heads. In the final rule,\nexempt research is now described at §__.104 and eight categories are included\n(see Section V [of the revised Common Rule preamble]).10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 9/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

Thus, under §__.101(c),\ndepartment or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular\nactivity is covered by the Common Rule, and this judgment should be exercised\nconsistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report. We note that under\nthe pre-2018 requirements Common Rule departments and agencies retained\nfinal authority as to whether a particular human subjects research study\nconducted or supported by that department or agency is covered by the Common\nRule (§__.101(c)) and that authority continues under the final regulations, but\nwith the new limitation that this judgment must be consistent with the ethical\nprinciples of the Belmont Report. This discretion provides important flexibility\ngiven the varying missions and policies of the many departments and agencies.\nAlthough some commenters were opposed to ever granting departments or\nagencies the authority permitted by §__.101(c), we believe requiring that these\ndecisions be consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report is an approach\nthat promotes accountability while still giving federal departments and agencies\nthe necessary flexibility to achieve their respective missions.\nThe final rule in §__.101(d) does not adopt the NPRM proposals, and instead\nretains the pre-2018 language. The NPRM proposed to modify §__.101(d) to say\nthat department or agency heads could require additional protections to research\nactivities conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies, but that\nwere not otherwise covered by the Common Rule. This language was intended as\na clarification to the pre-2018 language. However, we determined that the term10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 10/121“additional protections” could potentially be confusing in that the activities at\nissue in this provision are those for which no Common Rule protections are\nrequired; thus the protections imposed by department or agency heads might be\nthe only protections to which these activities are subject. We also note that\ndepartments or agencies conducting or supporting an activity subject to the\nCommon Rule may require additional protections for human subjects.\nThe final rule also does not incorporate the NPRM proposal in §__.101(d) that\nadvance public notice must be provided when a department or agency head\nrequires that the Common Rule, or part of it, be applied to research activities not\notherwise subject to the rule. Upon further assessment, we decided that such a\nrequirement could hinder the ability of a department or agency to move quickly in\ncases where the department or agency determined that additional protections are\nwarranted.\nSection __.101(i) of the final rule adopts a majority of the NPRM proposals. As\nproposed in the NPRM, §__.101(i) is modified to require that any alternative\nprocedures adopted by departments or agency heads are consistent with the\nprinciples of the Belmont Report. Also as proposed in the NPRM, §__.101(i) is\nmodified to state that, unless otherwise required by statute or executive order,\nnotice of these alternative procedures must be forwarded to OHRP (or any\nsuccessor o\u0000ice), or to the equivalent o\u0000ice within the appropriate federal\ndepartment or agency. The pre-2018 rule only listed OHRP (or any successor\no\u0000ice) as the o\u0000ice to which notices must be sent. This final rule modification is\nintended to ensure that if a non-HHS department or agency allows for alternative\nprocedures, the appropriate o\u0000ice within that same department or agency\nreceives notification. The final rule retains the pre-2018 requirement for the notice\nto also be published in the Federal Register or in such other manner provided for\nin department or agency procedures.\nThe final rule also adopts in §__.101(i) the NPRM proposal to require that the\nwaiver notice include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the\nwaiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for\nthe research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles in the\nBelmont Report.\nSection __.101(i) of the final rule does not include the NPRM proposal that would\nhave required each federal department or agency conducting or supporting the\nresearch to establish on a publicly accessible federal website a list of the research10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 11/121for which a waiver has been issued. We decided that the rule’s requirement to\npublish the waiver notice in the Federal Register, or in such other manner as\nprovided in department or agency procedures, adequately ensures that the waiver\nnotice will be available to the public without also requiring that such notices be\nlisted on a federal website. We note that some departments, such as HHS,\ncurrently post such notices on their websites.\nThe final rule thus formally codifies in §__.101(c) and (i) the general practice that\nthe ethical standards articulated in the Belmont Report are the ethical standards\nthat Common Rule departments or agencies will use in determining whether an\nactivity is covered under this policy or whether to grant a waiver of the\napplicability of some or all of the provisions (unless otherwise required by law).\nThe addition of the reference to the Belmont Report makes explicit the ethical\nbasis underpinning how waiver decisions have and must be considered.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves. As such, the agency interpretation\nof the substantive regulatory requirements may change from what a preamble\nindicated.

However, the final rule adds clarifying language\nproviding that the referenced state or local laws or regulations include tribal laws\npassed by the o\u0000icial governing body of an AI/AN tribe. Thus, if the o\u0000icial\ngoverning body of a tribe passes a tribal law that provides additional protections\nfor human subjects, the Common Rule does not a\u0000ect or alter the applicability of\nsuch tribal law. (Note that a similar change was also made to §__.116(i) and (j) to\nprovide the same clarification.)

Although the pre-2018 requirements\ncited the Declaration of Helsinki as an example of internationally recognized\nethical standards that a foreign country might use as its ethical base, we note that\nproviding a specific example of an internationally recognized ethical document is\nconcerning because such a document is subject to change independent of\nCommon Rule department or agency policies, and therefore might be modified in\nways that create standards that are inconsistent with U.S. laws and regulations.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

As such, the final rule\nimplements the NPRM proposal at §__.101(j). The final rule creates a requirement\nthat guidance should be issued only a\u0000er consultation among the Common Rule\ndepartments and agencies, while also permitting guidance to be issued without\nsuch consultation when it is not feasible. The proposal recognizes that\nharmonization will not always be possible or desirable given the varied missions\nof the departments and agencies that oversee the protection of human subjects\nand di\u0000erences in their statutory authorities.\nWe note that some public comments expressed concern about the acceptable\ndegree of variability among departments and agencies and encouraged attention\nto these concerns when diverging on guidance. The departments and agencies\nthat oversee the protection of human subjects have a variety of missions and\nfunctions, including regulatory agencies and agencies that conduct and support\nresearch. In addition, in some cases, statutory di\u0000erences among the departments\nand agencies have resulted in di\u0000erent regulatory requirements and guidance.\nThey also oversee very di\u0000erent types and phases of research and thus may have\nreasonable justifications for di\u0000erences in guidance. However, we agree that\ne\u0000orts should be made to issue collective guidance when possible and feasible\nand in a timely manner. We do not believe that this provision will result in the\nissuance of less guidance, because it largely codifies what has been the working\npractice among Common Rule departments and agencies up to this point.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

This election must be documented by the institution or an IRB.

We generally expect that this definition will be applied\nharmoniously with the definition of clinical trial recently promulgated in the\nClinicalTrials.gov final rule.\nIn response to public concerns about an overly expansive definition of “clinical\ntrial” given the importance of that definition to the proposed extension of the rule\nto clinical trials previously not covered by the rule, we have eliminated that\nproposed expansion of coverage in this final rule.

To add clarity to the definition found in the pre-\n2018 regulations, the example of the Secretary of HHS was inserted.\nThe final rule provides at §__.102(d) a definition of “federal department or\nagency” in order to avoid confusion as to whether this phrase encompasses\nfederal departments and agencies that do not follow the Common Rule. The\ndefinition also clarifies that this phrase refers to the department or agency itself,\nnot its bureaus, o\u0000ices, or divisions. This is consistent with the historical\ninterpretation of the Common Rule. Related to this, the definition of “institution”\nwas changed at §__.102(f) in the final rule to clarify that departments can be\nconsidered institutions for the purposes of this policy.

It is clear\nfrom the comments received that the public has significant and appropriate\nconcern about both the need for obtaining consent before using such\nbiospecimens for research, and the potential negative impacts of implementing\nthat proposal on the ability to conduct research. And, while it does not\nsubstantially change the definition of “identifiable private information,” the final\nrule includes a new process by which Common Rule departments and agencies\ncan regularly assess the scientific and technological landscape to determine\nwhether new developments merit reconsideration of how identifiability of either\ninformation or biospecimens is interpreted in the context of research. Because the\nfinal rule does not implement the NPRM's proposed expansion to the definition of\n“human subject,” it also does not implement the NPRM proposal to exclude\ncertain research activities involving nonidentified biospecimens.\nWith regard to changing the definition of “human subject” to include all\nbiospecimens, the majority of commenters who addressed this expansion\nopposed it for a variety of reasons, as described above. As explained in the NPRM,\none of the core reasons for proposing that the rule be broadened to cover all\nbiospecimens, regardless of identifiability, was based on the premise that\ncontinuing to allow secondary research with biospecimens collected without\nconsent for research places the publicly funded research enterprise in an\nincreasingly untenable position because it is not consistent with the majority of\nthe public's wishes, which reflect legitimate autonomy interests. However, the10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 19/121public comments on this proposal raise su\u0000icient questions about this premise\nsuch that we have determined that the proposal should not be adopted in this\nfinal rule.\nFurther, the current regulatory policy appears to su\u0000iciently protect against the\nunauthorized research use of identifiable biospecimens. Under the pre-2018 rule,\nif an investigator funded by a Common Rule department or agency uses\nnonidentified biospecimens and manages to re-identify them, that investigator\nwould then be conducting human subjects research without IRB approval, in\nviolation of the rules. It should also be noted that the position adopted in the final\nrule does not eliminate any authority, separate and apart from the Common Rule,\nthat Common Rule departments and agencies have to establish policies with\nadditional requirements related to consent for research involving nonidentifiable\nbiospecimens or nonidentifiable private information, or preclude them from\nexercising such authority.\nNonetheless, we acknowledge the need to also appropriately respect and\npromote autonomy interests. Any future proposals aimed at promoting autonomy\nshould jointly evaluate the importance of the autonomy interests at issue, as well\nas explicitly quantify the potential negative impacts the proposal might have on\nthe ability to conduct research, including such consequences on the\nrepresentativeness of biospecimens available for research.\nIn the final rule, we have added requirements to the informed consent process to\nincrease transparency so that potential subjects will have more information about\nhow their biospecimens or private information might be used. Specifically,\nprospective subjects will be told that identifiers might be removed from their\nbiospecimens or private information and used for future research, if this might be\na possibility. Finally, as some public comments addressed the desire to share in\nany profits that might accrue as a result of research use of their biospecimens, an\nadditional element of consent will require, as appropriate, a statement that the\nsubject’s biospecimens may be used for commercial profit and whether the\nsubject will or will not share in this commercial profit. We believe that this\nincreased attention to transparency in the consent process will allow individuals\nto make informed choices about whether they want to consent to current or\nfuture research uses of their biospecimens. A few clarifying changes are made in10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 20/121the final rule pertaining to the definition of “human subject” and the components\nwithin that definition, particularly referring to both information and biospecimens\nas key determinants of whether a human subject is involved in research.\nWith respect to the definition of “identifiable private information,” although the\npre-2018 definition of “identifiable” did not incorporate a specific process for\nconsidering the growing volume of information being generated and shared in\nresearch (including from biospecimens), or consider how evolving technology can\nease and speed the ability to re-identify information or biospecimens previously\nconsidered nonidentifiable, we appreciate that a change in that definition could\nhave collateral implications with respect to imposing unwarranted consent\nrequirements on activities that were not subject to the regulations. We appreciate\nthe commenter requests for more guidance on how they should interpret the\ndefinition of identifiable private information. Thus, although the final rule only\nmakes minor changes to the existing definition of “identifiable private\ninformation,” it sets in place a process (§__.102(e)(7), discussed below) that will\nhelp facilitate any necessary future updates to the understanding of that term.\nIn the final rule the language at §__.102(e)(1)(i) relating to information obtained\nthrough intervention or interaction with an individual was adopted and modified\nby replacing the reference to data, as proposed in the NPRM, with a reference to\ninformation or biospecimens, and by adding the NPRM-proposed language\nrelating to using, studying, or analyzing the information or biospecimens. The\nexplicit reference to biospecimens in this context is intended as a mere\nclarification of the previous understanding of how the pre-2018 rule operated.\nLikewise, the final rule adopts the NPRM-proposed language at §__.102(e)(1)(ii)\nrelating to obtaining identifiable private information, but modifies it by adding an\nexplicit reference to “identifiable biospecimens.” This is also intended as a mere\nclarification of the previous understanding of how the pre-2018 rule operated as\napplied to biospecimens. Similarly, the definition of intervention has been\nmodified to clarify that information or biospecimens might be gathered, replacing\nthe former reference only to data. This, too, is merely a clarification of the existing\nunderstanding of that concept.\nA definition of “identifiable biospecimen” has been added at §__.102(e)(6). This\nnew definition was not added as a result of any substantive change, but rather to\nenable greater clarity in other provisions of these regulations in explaining when a\nparticular provision relates to either identifiable private information alone (not10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 21/121including biospecimens), or identifiable biospecimens alone, or both. The pre-\n2018 rule’s concept of “identifiable private information” had encompassed the\nconcept of an identifiable biospecimen, whereas under the final rule that concept\nhas been “cleaved o\u0000” from that definition and given its own definition. Note that\na biospecimen is deemed to include private information (consistent with the\nunderstanding of this concept under the pre-2018 rule), so there is no need to add\nthe adjective “private” in the definition of an “identifiable biospecimen.” In e\u0000ect,\nonce a biospecimen becomes identifiable (for example, by being tagged with the\nname or other information that indicates the person from whom the biospecimen\nwas obtained), then an investigator using that biospecimen is already using\nsomething to which §__.102(e)(1)(ii) would apply. There is no need to make any\nadditional determination about the “private” aspects of what is taking place.\nIn addition, the minor clarifying change in the language for the concept of “private\ninformation” that was proposed in the NPRM, namely adding the phrase “shared\nor,” was not adopted. It was decided that because any information that should not\nbe shared would always meet the standard of being information that should not\nbe made public, this change would not actually expand the amount of\ninformation that is considered private information.\nAlthough the description of when private information is identifiable was not\nsignificantly changed, a new provision has been added at §__.102(e)(7) requiring\nfederal departments and agencies that implement the Common Rule to regularly,\nupon consultation with appropriate experts, reexamine the meaning of the terms\n“identifiable private information,” as defined in §__.102(e)(5), and “identifiable\nbiospecimen,” as defined in §__.102(e)(6). Such reexamination shall take place at\nleast every 4 years. This new provision specifically requires that the federal\ndepartments and agencies implementing this policy collaborate on this process to\navoid a duplication of e\u0000orts and in order to have a consistent interpretation of\nthese terms.\nThis new process responds to the growing volume of information being generated\nand shared in research (including from biospecimens), and evolving technology\nthat can ease and speed the ability to re-identify information or biospecimens\npreviously considered nonidentifiable. With an increase in the number of\nexemptions included in this final rule, it will be important to reconsider the\npotential identifiability of information and biospecimens and facilitate uniform\ninterpretation to ensure adequate privacy and security measures are in place.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 22/121Section 102(e)(7) also provides that, a\u0000er conducting this process, if it is\ndetermined to be appropriate and permitted by law, Common Rule departments\nand agencies could alter the interpretation of identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens, including through the use of guidance.\nIn addition, there will occur, also at least every 4 years and as a collaborative\nprocess among those federal departments and agencies, upon consultation with\nappropriate experts, an assessment as to whether there are analytic technologies\nand techniques that should be considered by investigators to generate identifiable\nprivate information or identifiable biospecimens. The ultimate goal is to\nimplement the Common Rule in a way that is aligned with the evolving\nunderstanding of the concept of identifiability while protecting subjects and\nencouraging and facilitating valuable research.\nTo the extent that this process leads to a determination that particular analytic\ntechnologies or techniques, when applied to information or biospecimens that\nare not identified, do lead to the generation of identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens, those technologies or techniques will be placed on a\nlist of technologies and techniques satisfying that determination, and\nrecommendations might accordingly be made with regard to relevant issues\nrelating to consent and privacy and data security protections. The result may be\nthat such technologies and techniques could therefore only be used in instances\nwhere the person has provided their consent (broad or study-specific) which\nmeets the requirements of the Common Rule, or where an IRB has waived the\nrequirement for consent.\nNotice and the opportunity for public comment would take place before a\ntechnology or technique could be placed on this list. The expectation is that whole\ngenome sequencing will be one of the first technologies to be evaluated to\ndetermine whether it should be placed on this list.\nIt is important to note that an investigator who possesses information or\nbiospecimens to which such a technology or technique might be applied is not to\nbe considered in possession of identifiable private information or identifiable\nbiospecimens merely as a result of such a circumstance: that would only be true\nwere the investigator to actually apply the technology or technique to generate\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 23/121This new provision is not being added as a result of any pre-conceived\ndetermination that there is indeed a need to change, whether by guidance or\notherwise, the interpretation of “individually identifiable” as that concept is\ncurrently interpreted. Consistent with a core theme underpinning the process that\nled to this final rule, it would be inappropriate to expand the scope of coverage of\nthe Common Rule with regard to activities that usually involve very little risk\nabsent good reason to think that there is a problem that the added administrative\nburden will be correcting. The public comments on both the ANPRM and the\nNPRM do not identify a specific problem, but clarification from the regulatory\nagencies might be useful. Thus, apart from the consequences of placing\ntechnologies and techniques on the new list, the most significant e\u0000ect of\n§__.102(e)(7) may be the issuance of guidance from time to time that facilitates\nunderstanding of and compliance with existing interpretations.\n \nFinally, with regard to the use of newborn DBS, retaining the pre-2018 approach\ntoward nonidentified biospecimens resolves many of the concerns expressed by\ncommenters who felt that important research involving newborn screening would\nbe halted or inhibited under the NPRM. The Newborn Screening Saves Lives\nReauthorization Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-240) will no longer be e\u0000ective following\nthe e\u0000ective date of this final rule, given that its changes applied only until\nchanges to the Common Rule were promulgated. As a result, under the final rule,\nsecondary research with nonidentified newborn DBS would be treated in the\nsame way as secondary research with any other type of nonidentified\nbiospecimen. Such research would not be considered research with human\nsubjects under the final rule, and thus would not be subject to the rule.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

In these jurisdictions, an individual recognized by institutional\npolicy as acceptable for providing consent in the nonresearch context to the\nsubject’s participation in the procedures involved in the research, will now be\nconsidered a legally authorized representative for purposes of this rule.\nThe change made from the NPRM discussion that “accepted common practice”\ncould be used to identify a legally authorized representative is in response to\nobjections to the vagueness of these terms and the potential for confusion in\nimplementation, which was expressed by the majority of commenters opposed to\nthe proposal. We agree with the commenters’ suggestion that an institution’s own\npolicies as to surrogate consent may be a better touchstone than “accepted\ncommon practice,” as a standard referencing institutional policy will provide\nadditional clarity as to who may serve as a legally authorized representative at\nthat particular institution.\nThe final rule also di\u0000ers from the NPRM discussion in that it allows institutional\npolicies applicable to surrogate consent in either the clinical context, or other\nnonresearch contexts, to authorize a legally authorized representative. We expect\nthat implementation of this aspect of the final rule definition will in large part rely\non institutional policies for determining surrogates for clinical decision making. In\nthose instances, there is relatively little risk that this rule will have inappropriate\nconsequences, as far more significant considerations, not related to the Common\nRule, play a role in shaping and constraining an institution’s policies relating to\nsurrogate decision making in the clinical context.\nHowever, we recognize that some studies could be taking place that do not relate\nto the types of decisions that are involved in clinical care, or that do not involve\nprocedures utilized in the clinical context. If the institution has a policy relating to\nwho acts as a surrogate outside of the research context for those types of\ndecisions, then such a policy could be employed in the research context. Similar\nto our assessment of policies relating to surrogate decision making in the clinical\ncontext, we expect that considerations not related to the Common Rule would10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 25/121constrain the institution’s design and implementation of policies in other\nnonresearch contexts, and thus see relatively little risk that this added regulatory\nflexibility will have inappropriate consequences.\nMaintaining the pre-2018 standard would have continued to allow disparate\nresults in terms of when research can take place in those states that have specific\nlaws governing either surrogate clinical consent or research consent, and those\nthat do not. Accepting that the Common Rule has been interpreted to allow the\nuse of laws governing surrogate consent in the clinical context to be applied to\nsurrogate decision making in the research context, it is di\u0000icult to see why there\nshould be di\u0000erent outcomes in terms of what research is allowable based on\nwhether the standards for surrogate consent in the clinical context in a state are\nbased on specific laws or some other accepted regime.\nThis outcome also appears inconsistent with the Belmont Report principle of\njustice. Individuals who lack the capacity to consent to research ought not be\ninappropriately excluded from research participation based solely on these\ncircumstances. Research that an IRB has approved as ethical to conduct with the\nparticipation of subjects with impaired decision-making capacity ought not be\nprohibited in the few states and jurisdictions in which no a\u0000irmative law\nauthorizing a legally authorized representative exists, while being allowed to\nproceed in the vast majority of states and jurisdictions that have laws specifically\nauthorizing consent by a legally authorized representative in the clinical or\nresearch context.\nReduced ambiguity in the interpretation of the regulatory requirements will\nfacilitate research that may o\u0000er the promise of improved medical treatment for\nthis subject population, thus increasing beneficence. This approach reflects the\ncalls for increased clarity in the regulatory requirements regarding who may serve\nas a legally authorized representative, which will serve to facilitate the responsible\ninclusion of subjects who cannot consent on their own behalf to research\nparticipation.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 26/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

Specifically, because the definition of\n“research” (§__.102(l)(2)) removes from that definition public health surveillance\nactivities that are conducted, supported, requested, ordered, required, or\nauthorized by a public health authority, this definition of “public health authority”\nclarifies the scope of the activities removed from the definition of “research” for\nthe purposes of this final rule.\nIn the final rule, as in the NPRM, the term “public health authority” means an\nagency or authority of the United States, a state, a territory, a political subdivision\nof a state or territory, an Indian tribe, or a foreign government, or a person or\nentity acting under a grant of authority from or contract with such public agency,\nincluding the employees or agents of such public agency or its contractors or\npersons or entities to whom it has granted authority, that is responsible for public\nhealth matters as part of its o\u0000icial mandate. We received no public comments on\nthis definition.\n[Back to top]\n§__.102(l) Research\nIn response to the public comments, the NPRM’s general approach of designating\nvarious categories of activities as excluded has not been adopted. Instead, the\nfinal rule reverts to the general structure of the pre-2018 rule and integrates some\nof the categories proposed for exclusion in the NPRM into that structure, with\nsome changes to the categories.\nThe final rule retains the wording of the pre-2018 definition of research, and\nexplicitly removes four categories of activities from activities that would meet that\ndefinition. These revisions are intended to make the rule simpler, more familiar to\nreaders who are aware of the pre-2018 rule and its definition of research, and\neasier to understand.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 28/121The four categories of activities removed from the definition of research are set\nout in order to make clear that they are not within the jurisdiction of the rule. The\nfour categories pertain to certain scholarly and journalistic activities, public health\nsurveillance activities, criminal justice activities, and authorized operational\nactivities in support of national security missions. These categories were\nproposed as exclusions in the NPRM; the final rule retains these categories, with\nsome changes made in the wording for clarity, in response to public comments.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

This category of activities concerns certain activities in various\nfields that focus directly on the specific individuals about whom information are\ncollected. As described above, this category is removed from the definition in\norder to resolve long-standing debate and uncertainty about whether these\nactivities are considered research in the sense of the regulatory definition. We\nbelieve that these activities should not be considered research in the context of\nthe Common Rule, and that making this explicit in the final rule will help to\nresolve the uncertainty.\nIn these activities, the ethical requirement is to provide an accurate and evidence-\nbased portrayal of the individuals involved, and not necessarily to protect them\nfrom public scrutiny. For example, a biographer might collect and present factual10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 29/121information to support the biographer’s opinion about the character of an\nindividual to show that the individual does not deserve the positive reputation he\nor she enjoys in society. These fields of research have their own codes of ethics,\naccording to which, for example, consent is obtained for oral histories. We note\nthat this consent standard should address the issue of oral histories of tribal\nmembers. For these reasons, we have determined that it is appropriate to remove\nthese activities from the definition of research and from the scope of the Common\nRule.\nIn response to public comments, §__.102(l)(1) refers to more fields and\nmethodological traditions than were proposed in the NPRM. The final rule also\nexplicitly cites those fields and traditions as examples, in order to clarify that the\nfocus is on the specific activities that collect and use information about specific\nindividuals themselves, and not generalizing to other individuals, and that such\nactivities occur in various fields of inquiry and methodological traditions. Literary\ncriticism has been added as an example because while a piece of literary criticism\nmight focus on information about the author(s), it would typically focus on the\nspecific author(s) in view. Legal research has been added as an example because it\nwould o\u0000en focus on the circumstances of specific plainti\u0000s or parties involved in\na case. It is not the particular field that removes the activity from the definition,\nbut rather the particular activity’s focus on specific individuals.\nActivities described in §__.102(l)(1) may sometimes be performed in the fields of\nanthropology or sociology, but not all activities characteristic of these fields are\noutside of the rule. Studies using methods such as participant observation and\nethnographic studies, in which investigators gather information from individuals\nin order to understand their beliefs, customs, and practices, and the findings\napply to the studied community or group, and not just the individuals from whom\nthe information was obtained, fall within the scope of the definition of research of\nthe final rule.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

Additionally, the final rule explicitly specifies that the collection of\ninformation is permitted under this category of activities.\nThe final rule codifies the current interpretation that the definition of research\ndoes not include a category of activities that solely involve public health\nsurveillance, including collecting and testing information or biospecimens in\nactivities that are conducted, supported, requested, ordered, required, or\nauthorized by a public health authority and that are limited to those necessary to\nallow the public health authority to identify, monitor, assess, or investigate\npotential public health signals, onsets of disease outbreaks, or conditions of\npublic health importance. Such surveillance activities can include collecting\ninformation about trends, signals, risk factors, patterns in diseases, or increases in\ninjuries from using consumer products. Such activities include those associated\nwith providing timely situational awareness and priority-setting during the course\nof an event or crisis that threatens public health, including natural or man-made\ndisasters.\nThis codification of public health surveillance activities as outside the definition of\nresearch is designed to remove uncertainty, but is not intended to change the\nscope of activities subject to or not subject to the Common Rule. When a public\nhealth authority conducts public health surveillance activities to fulfill its legal\nmandate to protect and maintain the health and welfare of the populations it\noversees, the regulatory protections of the Common Rule should not impede that\nauthority’s ability to accomplish its mandated mission of promoting this\nrecognized public good, in keeping with the principle of beneficence. Other\nprotections independent of the Common Rule exist that serve to protect the rights\nand welfare of individuals participating in such activities, including federal and\nstate policies to protect privacy, confidentiality, and security safeguards for the\ninformation collected.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 31/121Public health surveillance refers to collecting, analyzing, and using data to target\npublic health and disease prevention. It is the foundation of public health\npractice. Surveillance uses data from a variety of sources, including mandatory\nreporting of certain conditions, routine monitoring, vital records, medical billing\nrecords, and public health investigations. The line between public health\nsurveillance and epidemiological research can be di\u0000icult to draw, as the same\nepidemiological techniques may be used in both. Generally, the di\u0000erence\nbetween the activities is the purpose or context in which the investigation is being\nconducted and the role of the public health authority.\nThe following are examples of public health surveillance activities being codified\nas outside of the definition of research in this regulation:\nSafety and injury surveillance activities designed to enable a public health\nauthority to identify, monitor, assess, and investigate potential safety signals\nfor a specific product or class of products (for example, the surveillance\nactivities of the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System, the Vaccine Adverse\nEvent Reporting System,Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience\ndatabase, the Medical Product Safety Network, and the Sentinel Initiative);\nSurveillance activities designed to enable a public health authority to identify\nunexpected changes in the incidence or prevalence of a certain disease in a\ndefined geographic region where specific public health concerns have been\nraised (e.g., the U.S. influenza surveillance system, which allows CDC to find\nout when and where influenza activity is occurring, track influenza-related\nillness, determine what strains of influenza virus are circulating, detect\nchanges in influenza viruses, and measure the impact influenza is having on\nhospitalizations and deaths in the United States);\nSurveillance activities designed to enable a public health authority to identify\nthe prevalence of known risk factors associated with a health problem in the\ncontext of a domestic or international public health emergency;\nSurveillance activities designed to enable a public health authority to locate\nthe range and source of a disease outbreak or to identify cases of a disease\noutbreak;\nSurveillance activities designed to enable a public health authority to detect\nthe onset of disease outbreaks or provide timely situational awareness during\nthe course of an event or crisis that threatens the public health, such as a\nnatural or man-made disaster; and,10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 32/121Surveillance activities designed to enable a public health authority to identify\nthe prevalence of a condition of public health importance, known risk factors\nassociated with a condition of public health importance, or behaviors or\nmedical practices related to prevalence of a known condition of public health\nimportance (e.g., surveillance of the prevalence of: tobacco use, exposure to\nsecondhand smoke, lung cancer, or use of smoking cessation treatments).\nOn the other hand, subsequent research using information collected during a\npublic health surveillance activity, for instance, genetic analysis of biospecimens,\nwould not be removed from the definition.\n \nThis clarification of current interpretation would not remove the following\nactivities from the definition of “research”: exploratory studies designed to better\nunderstand risk factors for chronic diseases, including genetic predisposition, for\nchronic diseases; exploratory studies designed to elucidate the relationships\nbetween biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers of disease; and exploratory\nstudies of potential relationships between behavioral factors (e.g., diet) and\nindicators of environmental exposures. These types of activities would be\nconsidered research because they would not be conducted solely for the purposes\ndescribed in §__.102(l)(2), and thus would be covered by the Common Rule if they\ninvolved human subjects, even if conducted by a federal agency with a public\nhealth mandate. Again, they might fall within an exemption, depending on how\nthey are carried out.\nWe note that this provision does apply to some activities responding to\nemergencies, and that various department or agency activities, not just those of\nHHS, will be a\u0000ected. Research evaluations of public health surveillance activities\nare not included in this category because the nature of such evaluations is to\ncreate generalizable knowledge. We also recognize that in some public health\nsurveillance activities, it may be appropriate to obtain consent from the\nindividuals from whom information or biospecimens are collected.\nWe recognize the public comments stating that the boundaries of public health\nsurveillance activities being removed from the definition of research are not\nentirely clear. We recognize that some of the activities in this category are not\nresearch, but believe that the inclusion of this provision will help to resolve\nuncertainty in some circumstances about whether the rule applies. We believe\nthat developing guidance in this area will be useful.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 33/121Finally, to clarify what public health surveillance activities are being removed from\nthe definition of research, the final rule contains a new definition of “public health\nauthority” at §__.102(k).\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

The scope of these activities is collection\nand analysis of information, biospecimens, or records by or for a criminal justice\nagency for activities authorized by law or court order solely for criminal justice or\ncriminal investigative purposes. The activities are necessary for the operation and\nimplementation of the criminal justice system. The final rule changes the wording\nof the category from that proposed in the NPRM only by substituting the word\n“information” for “data,” for consistency with other parts of the rule.\nThe provision essentially codifies current federal interpretation that such activities\nare not considered to be research under the Common Rule. Revising the\nregulations to explicitly remove such activities from the scope of research subject\nto the rule is designed to avoid the imposition of disparate requirements by IRBs\nwith overlapping jurisdictions when information collection or analysis\nencompasses the development of methods required by law or court order for\ncriminal justice or criminal investigative purposes. For example, the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) is charged by law with setting standards governing\nthe collection and processing of DNA biospecimens and information taken\n(forcibly if necessary) from certain federal and state criminal suspects or o\u0000enders\nincident to their arrest or conviction for prescribed o\u0000enses under the National\nDNA Identification Act of 1994 and other acts. Similarly, the FBI is charged by law10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 34/121with setting standards governing the collection and processing of fingerprints and\nrelated biographical information taken from federal and state criminal suspects or\no\u0000enders and certain sensitive civil employment applicants. Many criminal law\nenforcement agencies routinely collect human biospecimens at crime scenes from\nor relating to victims, suspects, and o\u0000enders both known and unknown. Incident\nto these activities, the FBI is also charged with maintaining, and authenticating\nthrough identification processes, the criminal record history of criminal o\u0000enders\nfor federal government agencies and for the overwhelming majority of state\ngovernments that elect to participate and share information through those\nsystems. We have determined that this category of activities does not meet the\ndefinition of research in the final rule, so that these activities can be conducted in\naccordance with the legitimate goals of the criminal justice system.\nWe do not believe that this provision contradicts President Clinton’s 1997\nmemorandum, which addressed the regulatory requirements for certain activities\nthat are considered research under the regulations. This category pertains to\nactivities that are outside of the regulatory requirements.\nThis category is also not intended to include social and behavioral studies of the\ncauses of criminal behavior. Such studies would be considered research under the\nfinal rule.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

This clarification codifies the interpretation of the pre-2018 Common\nRule.\nAs described above, the final rule includes a simpler reference to authorized\noperational activities in support of national security missions not considered to be\nhuman subject research, as a response to concern that the NPRM proposal could\nbe interpreted too broadly or too narrowly due to the specific activities listed,\nsuch as surveys, interviews, surveillance activities and related analyses, and the\ncollection and use of biospecimens. These authorized operational activities, as\ndetermined by each agency, do not include research activities as defined by the\nCommon Rule, nor have they ever in the past been considered regulated by the\nCommon Rule. This category of activity is removed from the definition of research\nto make explicit that the requirements of the final rule do not apply to authorized\noperational activities in support of national security missions. This clarification is\nnot intended to narrow the scope of the Common Rule.\nWe do not believe that this category contradicts President Clinton’s Memorandum\nof 1997 regarding classified research, because this category is merely clarifying\nwhat activities are not considered to meet the definition of research.

We believe this requirement is\nunnecessary. Further, for international institutions that may receive federal\nfunding for research activities, it creates the impression that these international\ninstitutions must modify their internal procedures to comport with the set of\nprinciples designated on the FWA for activities conducted at those institutions\nthat receive no federal funding. OHRP has received many questions about the\nextent to which international institutions must adhere to the ethical principles\ndesignated as part of the assurance process for\nresearch activities conducted by the institution that receive no Common Rule\ndepartment or agency funding. That such measures are not required will be made\nclear by deletion of this requirement in the final rule.\nAdditionally, as proposed in the NPRM, the final rule eliminates the requirement\nthat appeared in the pre-2018 rule that an up-to-date list of the IRB members and\ntheir qualifications be included in an institution’s assurance. Instead, §§__.108(a)\n(2) and __.115(a)(5) in the final rule require that an IRB or the institution prepare\nand maintain a current list of IRB members. This eliminates the previous\nrequirement that changes in IRB membership be reported to the department or\nagency head, or to OHRP when the existence of an assurance approved by HHS for\nfederal-wide use is accepted. Of note, SACHRP recommended in March, 2008 that\nOHRP pursue harmonizing the Common Rule with FDA’s human subjects\nprotection regulations by eliminating the requirement to submit IRB membership\nlists.\nThe final rule, as proposed in the NPRM, also eliminates the requirement that\nappeared in the pre-2018 rule that an institution designate one or more IRBs on its\nFWA. Federal departments or agencies retain the ability to ask for information\nabout which IRBs review research conducted at an institution as part of the\nassurance process, even if that requirement is not explicitly mandated in the\nregulations.\nAn additional, a nonregulatory change that was described in the NPRM will be\nmade to the assurance mechanism. The prior option that enabled institutions\nwith an active FWA to \"check the box\" (described in section IV.A [of the final rule10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 39/121preamble]) is being eliminated. Importantly, institutions could, if they so desire,\ncontinue for purposes of their own internal rules to voluntarily extend the  \nregulations to all research conducted by the institution, but this voluntary\nextension will no longer be part of the assurance process and such research will\nnot be subject to OHRP oversight. We expect this change to have the beneficial\ne\u0000ect of encouraging some institutions to explore a variety of flexible approaches\nto overseeing low-risk research that is not funded by a Common Rule department\nor agency, without reducing protection of human subjects, thus furthering the\ngoal to decrease inappropriate administrative burdens.\nIn addition, as proposed in the NPRM, the final rule removes the provision found\nin the pre-2018 rule that a department or agency head’s evaluation of an\nassurance will take into consideration the adequacy of the proposed IRB(s)\ndesignated under the assurance in light of the anticipated scope of the\ninstitution’s activities and the types of subject populations likely to be involved,\nthe appropriateness of the proposed initial and continuing review procedures in\nlight of the probable risks, and the size and complexity of the institution. We\nbelieve this deletion aligns the regulations with changes made in December 2000\nto OHRP’s implementation of the FWA process. Those changes streamlined and\nsimplified the assurance process and eliminated OHRP’s institution-specific\nevaluation of the adequacy of each IRB designated under the assurance. \nEach FWA-holding institution continues to have responsibility for ensuring that\nthe IRBs on which it relies are registered with OHRP and are appropriately\nconstituted to review and approve the institution’s human subjects research, as\nrequired under §§__.107 and __.108 of the final rule.\nThe final rule contains language at §__.103(e) requiring that for nonexempt\nresearch involving human subjects (or exempt research that requires limited IRB\nreview) that takes place at an institution for which an IRB not operated by that\ninstitution exercises oversight, the institution and the organization operating the\nIRB must document the institution’s reliance on the IRB for its research oversight.\nThe final rule also requires that this documentation include the responsibilities of\neach entity to ensure compliance with the requirements of the rule.\nThe requirement included in the final rule for documenting an institution’s\nreliance on an IRB that it does not operate is more flexible than what was\nproposed in the NPRM. The final rule only requires that the reliance agreement\nbetween the institution and the organization operating the IRB be documented. It10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 40/121does not include the NPRM proposal that the institution and the organization\noperating the IRB establish and follow procedures for documenting the\ninstitution’s reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and delineating the\nresponsibilities that each entity would assume to ensure compliance with the\nrequirements of the rule.\nIn considering the public comments, we determined that it was unnecessary to\nrequire that such reliance relationships be described in institutional procedures.\nUnder the final rule, compliance with this provision could be achieved in a variety\nof flexible ways, for example, through a written agreement between the institution\nand a specific IRB, through language contained in a protocol of a multi-\ninstitutional study, or more broadly, by implementation of an institution-wide\npolicy directive providing the allocation of responsibilities between the institution\nand all IRBs that are not operated by the institution. Documenting the\nresponsibilities of the institution and the IRB is already a requirement under the\nterms of an FWA, but is now a regulatory requirement. An additional requirement\nhas been added at §__.115(a)(9) that such documentation be part of the IRB\nrecords.\nWe acknowledge that the new requirement could increase administrative burden\nfor some institutions, but believe that the examples cited above reflecting the\nvarious options an institution may use to document reliance on an IRB not\noperated by that institution are generally already standard practice in the\nregulated community.\nFinally, the final rule eliminates the requirement in the pre-2018 rule at §__.103(f)\nthat grant applications undergo IRB review and approval for the purposes of\ncertification. The grant application is o\u0000en outdated by the time the research\nstudy is submitted for IRB review and contains detailed information about the\ncosts of a study, personnel, and administrative issues that go beyond the mission\nof the IRB to protect human subjects. Therefore, experience suggests that review\nand approval of the grant application is not a productive use of IRB time.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 41/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

Exempt Research\n§__.104(b) Applicability of Exemptions to Subparts\nB, C, and D\nThe NPRM proposal regarding how the proposed exemptions may be applied to\nthe subparts is largely unchanged in the final rule. The language at §__.104(b)(2)\nregarding subpart C has been modified slightly to reduce ambiguity and potential\nadministrative burden, and in response to public comment, to narrow the scope\nof exemption application. The final rule does not adopt the 2003 epidemiological\nwaiver language due to concerns from public comments that such language\nwould be ambiguous and di\u0000icult to interpret.\nThe final rule section__.104(b)(1) states that all of the exemptions at §__.104 may\nbe applied to research conducted under subpart B if the conditions of the\nexemption are met. Language at §__.104(b)(2) states that none of the §__.104\nexemptions may be applied to research conducted under subpart C, except for\nresearch aimed at involving a broader subject population that only incidentally\nincludes prisoners. This is a modification of the NPRM language, which proposed\nthat the exemptions could apply if research consisted “mostly of nonprisoners and\nonly incidentally” included some number of prisoners. The language was changed\nin order to avoid the implied need (“mostly”) for institutions to project and track\nthe percentage of prisoners participating in nonexempt research. The revision also\nmore clearly describes and limits the circumstances in which exempt research\nmay include prisoners. The language at §__.104(b)(3) relevant to subpart D has\nbeen modified to reflect the revised structure of the final rule, and now states that10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 42/121the exemptions at paragraphs (d)(1), and (d)(4)-(8) of this section may be applied\nto research that is subject to subpart D if the conditions of the exemption are met.\nParagraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section may apply only to research activities\nthat are subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of\npublic behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being\nobserved. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research that\nis subject to subpart D, because protections, including IRB review and parental\npermission, are appropriate for research involving children and educational tests,\nsurveys or interview procedures, or observation of public behavior when the\ninformation collected may be individually identified and sensitive in nature.\nThe final rule does not make revisions to the HHS regulations at 45 CFR part 46,\nsubparts B, C, and D. Throughout this rulemaking process, the intent has been to\nrevise subpart A, and to address revisions to subparts B, C, and D at a later time.\nHowever, particular consideration has been given to the specific issue of whether\nthe proposed exemption categories should apply in the context of research that is\naimed at a broad population and only incidentally includes prisoners. We concur\nwith the comments expressing support for this change.\nIn such instances, the specific protections required by subpart C are frequently not\nrelevant to the research subjects. The permitted inclusion of this subset of\nprisoners under the exemptions at §__.104 is intended to allow an appropriate\nreduction in IRB administrative burden while preventing IRBs from necessarily\nprohibiting the participation of this group in exempt research activities, assuming\nthe conditions of the exemptions are fully satisfied.\nWe believe this subpart C change is narrow in scope, a\u0000ecting only a small subset\nof subjects who are prisoners. This change will permit, for example, the exempt\nsecondary research use of information or biospecimens from subjects who are\nprisoners, if that analysis is not seeking to examine prisoners as a population and\nonly incidentally includes prisoners in the broader study. Such inclusion would\npreviously have required IRB review under subpart C, including review by an IRB\nprisoner representative, followed by certification to and authorization by OHRP.

Four of the exemption categories were proposed as exclusions under the\nNPRM. In addition, the proposed exclusion concerning certain research involving\neducational tests, survey or interview procedures, or observation of public\nbehavior has been combined with the exemption regarding additional research\nactivities using the same research methods. The rule includes four exemptions for\nresearch involving normal educational practices, research involving benign\nbehavioral interventions, research involving public benefit or service programs,\nand research involving taste and food quality, all of which were also proposed in\nthe NPRM.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

This includes most research on\nregular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the\ne\u0000ectiveness of, or the comparison among, instructional techniques, curricula, or\nclassroom management methods.\nThis exemption is a revised version of the first exemption in the pre-2018 rule and\na modified version of the exemption as proposed in the NPRM. This change is\nbased on concerns about whether the conduct of some research projects of this\ntype might draw enough time and attention away from the delivery of the regular\neducational curriculum that they could have a detrimental e\u0000ect on student\nachievement. The wording of the exemption has been modified to include a\ncondition that the research is not likely to have these adverse impacts. This was\nthe original intent of the NPRM proposal, and it is an important qualification that\nshould apply to any research activity that is exempt under this provision. It also\ndrops the phrase “in that educational setting,” because that phrase is redundant.\nThe exemption is retained to allow for the conduct of education research that may\ncontribute to the important public good of improving education, consistent with\nthe principle of beneficence. The exemption retains the condition that the\nresearch activity takes place in established or commonly accepted educational\nsettings, because otherwise IRB review would be warranted for such research\nactivities being conducted in unconventional settings.\nWe recognize that providing notice for this type of research could involve a\nsignificant administrative burden and that it is not always appropriate, and\ntherefore have decided not to include it as a regulatory requirement at this time.\nWe note that making these activities exempt does not mean that there ought not\nto be tribal consultation about the research activities, and that such consultation\nmay lead to a notice requirement. Where appropriate or mandated by tribal law,\ntribal consultation should take place irrespective of whether the activity has to\nmeet the requirements of this final rule. Such consultation would represent a free-\nstanding legal obligation, as is referred to in §__.101(f).When appropriate,\ninvestigators may provide notice in a manner that is appropriate to the research\nactivity and the cultural context in which it occurs.\nThis exemption is largely unchanged from the pre-2018 rule, and does not add\nrequirements for safeguarding privacy at this time.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 46/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

The exemption applies to research that only\nincludes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude,\nachievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public\nbehavior (including visual or auditory recording) uninfluenced by the investigator\nif at least one of three criteria is met:\nThe information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that\nthe identity of the human subject cannot readily be ascertained, directly or\nthrough identifiers linked to the subjects;\nAny disclosure of the human subjects’ responses outside the research would\nnot reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be\ndamaging to the subjects’ financial standing, employability, educational\nadvancement, or reputation; or10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 47/121The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that\nthe identity of human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through\nidentifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to\nmake the determination required by §__.111(a)(7) (which relate to there being\nadequate provisions for protecting privacy and maintaining confidentiality).\nThe final rule does not include the language proposed in the NPRM that o\u0000ered as\none prong of the exemption (proposed as an exclusion) that the research be\nsubject to the Privacy Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, or the E-Government Act\nof 2002. The final rule simply includes §__.104(d)(2)(iii), which requires limited IRB\nreview as described at §__.111(a)(7) if identifiable private information will be\nobtained and recorded in such a way that the identity of human subjects can\nreadily be ascertained, either directly or through identifiers linked to the subject.\nThis exemption is based on the assumption that the potential risks raised by this\ncategory are largely informational and that subjects are aware of them, and thus\nthe most important role that an IRB might play with respect to reducing potential\nharms is to ensure the application of privacy safeguards. Under this assumption,\nthe exemption is consistent with the principle of respect for persons and the\npreservation of autonomy. In the case of observation of public behavior, even if\nthe subject does not know that an investigator is watching his or her actions, the\nsubject’s behavior is public and could be observed by others, and thus the\nresearch observation is not inappropriately intrusive.\nThe term “survey” as used here refers to information collected about individuals\nthrough questionnaires or similar procedures (e.g., the Current Population Survey\nconducted by the U.S. Census). “Human subjects” do not include organizations or\nbusinesses. “Survey,” as used here, does not include the collection of\nbiospecimens. Thus, an activity that included the collection of a biospecimen\n(e.g., a cheek swab), in addition to collecting verbal or written responses to\nquestions, could not qualify for this exemption.\nThis exemption includes the research activities that appeared at §__.101(b)(2) in\nthe pre-2018 rule, as well as some additional information collection research\nactivities using the same methods. As in the pre-2018 rule, this exemption\nincludes research studies whose methods consist of the use of educational tests,\nsurvey or interview procedures, or observation of public behavior that does not\ninvolve an intervention, if the data are recorded anonymously, or the information\nis recorded with identifiers, but is not sensitive such that its disclosure could10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 48/121result in harm to the subjects. The exemption provides a list of the specific harms\nthat must be considered, as did the pre-2018 rule, with the addition of the specific\nharm of potential damage to the subjects’ educational advancement. This\npotential harm has been added because of the obvious relevance to the e\u0000ects of\nthe disclosure of responses in research involving educational tests.\nThis exemption has been expanded to include research using the same methods\ninvolving identifiable private information that might be sensitive or potentially\nharmful if disclosed, so long as the investigators adhere to the limited IRB\nrequirements outlined in §__.111(a)(7), and the research is not subject to Subpart\nD. The limited IRB review requirements are designed to provide privacy\nsafeguards to reduce the chances that the disclosure of identifiable private\ninformation will occur and lead to harm.\nThe wording of the exemption is clarified to indicate (consistent with the\ninterpretation of §__.101(b)(2) in the pre-2018 rule) that the research cannot\ninclude interventions in addition to the educational tests, survey or interview\nprocedures, or observation of public behavior. Research involving interventions\nthat are distinct from those information collection methods allowable under this\nexemption do not satisfy the conditions of this exemption. For example, if a\nresearch study were to randomly assign students to take an educational test in a\nquiet room or in a room with a moderate level of noise, or to consume a snack (or\nnot) before taking the test, this research would not be exempt under this\nexemption. It should be noted, however, that educational tests may include\nexposing test takers to certain materials as part of the test, and that such\nmaterials do not constitute interventions distinct from the test. For example,\nreading comprehension tests may direct test takers to read a passage, and a\ngeography test may present test takers with a map, and ask them to draw\ninformation from that map. Likewise, survey procedures may contain some\ninformation that the respondents are asked questions about, which would not be\nconsidered distinct interventions. However, research in which the purpose of the\nresearch is to see whether respondents answer survey questions di\u0000erently\ndepending on the gender of the interviewer would not satisfy the conditions of\nthe exemption, because the manipulation of the interviewer would be a distinct\nintervention. Research involving observation of public behavior does not qualify\nfor this exemption if the investigator intervenes with subjects, for example, by\no\u0000ering them an ostensibly lost wallet to see if they will accept it.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 49/121Part of the rationale for exempting the research activities at §__.104(d)(2) from the\nCommon Rule, even when the research is not otherwise subject to additional\nfederal controls, is that for education tests, survey or interview procedures,\nagreement to participate is inherent in participation and that for much of this\nresearch the risks most likely to be experienced by subjects are related to\ndisclosure of anonymous, nonsensitive information and are thus categorized as\n“low.” In general, it is reasonable to expect that individuals, including vulnerable\npopulations (other than children), would understand that actively providing\nresponses to educational tests, surveys, or interview procedures constitutes\nagreement to participate and that the risks associated with such participation\nwould be related to disclosure of the information they provided. The exemption of\nthis type of activity rests in large part on the idea that all individuals, regardless of\nthe setting or context in which the activity will take place, are generally familiar\nwith common forms of educational tests and survey and interview procedures\nthat they experience in their daily lives, and do not need additional measures to\nprotect themselves and their privacy from investigators who seek their\ninvolvement in research activities involving these procedures. They can decline to\nparticipate, or to answer some questions. In addition, if the information collected\nis both identifiable and sensitive or potentially harmful, the safeguards o\u0000ered by\nthe limited IRB review requirements at §__.111(a)(7) apply. This is accomplished\nthrough the added provision at §__.104(d)(2)(iii).\nConcerns have also been raised about psychological risks of participating in\nsurveys or interviews, and of situational risks where the simple awareness that\nsomeone was surveyed or interviewed poses a risk. We recognize that this is\npossible, but believe that this is rare enough that it does not warrant adding\nadditional conditions to the exemption category.\nWith respect to applying this exemption to research with children, two\nsubcategories of this exemption - concerning information recorded so that\nsubjects cannot be identified (§__.104(d)(2)(i)), and concerning disclosures of the\nsubjects’ responses that would not place them at certain kinds of risk or create\ncertain kinds of damage (§__.104(d)(2)(ii)) may apply to research involving\nchildren under subpart D if the research involves educational tests or observation\nof public behavior and the investigator does not participate in the activities being\nobserved. The final subcategory of this exemption (§__.104(d)(2)(iii)), which\nallows for obtaining and recording identifiable private information, may not be\napplied to research involving children under subpart D.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 50/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

In response to public comments that expressed concern over the need\nto further clarify the term “benign interventions,” the word “behavioral” has been\ninserted to modify the type of intervention which may be included. The intent of\nthis change is to exclude the use of medical interventions (including medical tests,\nprocedures and devices). The exemption being finalized is specifically for research\ninvolving benign “behavioral” interventions in conjunction with the collection of\ninformation from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including\ndata entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the\nintervention and information collection and at least one of the following is met:\nThe information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that\nthe identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or\nthrough identifiers linked to the subjects;\nAny disclosure of the human subjects’ responses outside the research would\nnot reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be\ndamaging to the subjects’ financial standing, employability, educational\nadvancement, or reputation; or\nThe information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that\nthe identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or\nthrough identifiers linked to the subject, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB\nreview to make the determination required by §__.111(a)(7).10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 51/121For the purpose of this provision, the exemption describes benign behavioral\ninterventions as being brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically\ninvasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects,\nand the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions\no\u0000ensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such\nbenign behavioral interventions include having the subjects play an online game,\nsolve puzzles under various noise conditions, or decide how to allocate a nominal\namount of received cash between themselves and someone else.\nUnlike the exemption at §__.104(d)(2), this exemption allows for the intervention\nto be distinct from the data collection method; for example, a research study\ncomparing test performance of test takers in quiet or noisy surroundings would\nqualify for this exemption. Also subjects could be asked to perform cognitive\ntasks, and audiovisual recording could be used to collect the data, without any\neducational test, survey or interview procedure occurring, and this research\nwould qualify for this exemption.\nIf the research involves deceiving the subjects about the nature or purposes of the\nresearch, this exemption would not be applicable unless the subject authorizes\nthe deception. For the purpose of this provision, authorized deception would be\nprospective agreement by the subject to participate in research where the subject\nis informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or\npurposes of the research. The final rule allows this type of research to occur\nwithout the requirements of informed consent because the intervention is not\nlikely to result in harm or o\u0000ense to the subject, and the subject must\nprospectively agree to the intervention and the data collection.\nSubjects must be adults, but the provision does not specify that they must be\ncompetent, and therefore tests of competency are not necessary. However, the\npresumption is that, in keeping with the principle of respect for persons, such\nsubjects will not be exploited.\nThis new exemption category is added because respect for persons is\naccomplished through the prospective subject’s forthcoming agreement or\nauthorization to participate, the research activities pose little risk to subjects, and\nthe use of this exemption for many social or behavioral studies will enable IRBs to\ndevote more time and attention to research studies involving greater risks or\nethical challenges. We note that the requirement for the agreement of the subject10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 52/121e\u0000ectively serves as a kind of notice, because the subject is asked to agree to\nparticipate in the research, and the request will be tailored to the nature of the\nspecific research study.\nThe final rule includes another condition that was not included in the NPRM,\nwhich broadens the type of research that may meet this exemption. The final rule\nat §__.104(d)(3)(i)(C) permits\ninvestigators to obtain and record information in such a manner that the identity\nof the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers\nlinked to the subject, provided the research has undergone limited IRB review in\naccord with §__.111(a)(7). This alternative condition was added to the final rule\nfor reasons similar to the exemption at §__.104(d)(2), as a way of providing\nadditional protections when investigators obtain and record information in such a\nmanner that human subjects can be identified directly or through identifiers\nlinked to the subject. Because the risk associated with enabling investigators to\nobtain and record identifiable private information can be addressed by requiring\nadherence to the privacy safeguards provided through limited IRB review, we\nbelieve it is appropriate to allow such research to be exempt.\nIn addition, the final rule permits the collection of data through audiovisual\nrecording, not just video recording, as was proposed in the NPRM. We believe that\nbroadening the exemption in this way provides more flexibility to the permissible\ndata collection methods without creating greater risk of harm to research\nsubjects.\nWe acknowledge that guidance may be useful for interpreting some of the terms\nin this exemption, and that some cases will be debatable. However, we also\nbelieve that a substantial number of research activities will plainly fit this\nexemption, and should be allowed to proceed without IRB review. We agree that\ninvestigator education is o\u0000en desirable, but that the provisions of the exemption\nare not di\u0000icult to understand. We believe that Milgram’s obedience experiments\nand the Stanford Prison Experiment would obviously not qualify for this\nexemption, because investigators had reason to think some subjects would find\nthe interventions o\u0000ensive or embarrassing. We acknowledge that in this\nexemption the word “deception” is used to include withholding the purpose of the\nresearch, which is consistent with how the term is o\u0000en used in this context.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 53/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

Note that because the NPRM proposal to alter the\ndefinition of a human subject to extend to research involving nonidentified\nbiospecimens was not adopted, an exemption for research with such\nbiospecimens is not needed. Accordingly, this exemption is only relevant to\nsecondary research use of identifiable biospecimens.\nThe goal of the exemption at §__.104(d)(4) is to facilitate secondary research using\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens that have been or\nwill be collected or generated for nonresearch purposes or from research studies\nother than the proposed research study.

Under HIPAA, these protections\ninclude, where appropriate, requirements to\nobtain the individual’s authorization for future, secondary research uses of\nprotected health information, or waiver of that authorization by an IRB or HIPAA\nPrivacy Board. This provision introduces a clearer distinction between when the\nCommon Rule and the HIPAA Privacy Rule apply to research in order to avoid\nduplication of regulatory burden. We believe that the HIPAA protections are\nadequate for this type of research, and that it is unduly burdensome and\nconfusing to require applying the protections of both HIPAA and an additional set\nof protections.\nThis provision was not part of the pre-2018 rule, and was proposed as an exclusion\nin the NPRM.

It appears as a component of an\nexemption in the final rule. The exemption permits the use of identifiable private\ninformation or identifiable biospecimens for secondary research conducted by, or\non behalf of, a federal department or agency using government-generated or\ngovernment-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the\ninformation originally involved a collection that adheres to the federal standards\nfor safeguarding privacy as described in this part of the exemption.\nWe believe that the privacy protections are adequate for this type of research, and\nthat it is unduly burdensome and confusing to require these protections and an\nadditional set of protections.

The exemption at §__.104(d)(5) in the final rule applies to\nresearch and demonstration projects involving public benefit or service programs,\nand is a slightly revised version of the exemption in the pre-2018 rule. This revision\nis designed to clarify the scope of the exemption so that more research studies\nwould be eligible, and to make the exemption easier to apply. It is also designed to\nallow the Federal Government to carry out important evaluations of its public\nbenefit and service programs to ensure that those programs are cost e\u0000ective and\nprovide the intended benefits or services, consistent with the principle of\nbeneficence. The wording of the exemption has added “improve” to the purposes\nof these activities, to make more explicit the idea that the Federal Government\nconducts these activities in order to enable them to make the public benefit and\nservice programs better, and not just to gauge their current quality.\nThis exemption is for research and demonstration projects that are conducted or\nsupported by a federal department or agency, or otherwise subject to the\napproval of department or agency heads. It applies to activities that are designed\nto study, evaluate, improve, or otherwise examine public benefit or service\nprograms, including, but not limited to: procedures for obtaining benefits or\nservices under those programs; possible changes in or alternatives to those\nprograms or procedures; or possible changes in methods or levels of payment for\nbenefits or services under those programs.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 60/121In addition, the final rule clarifies the language of the exemption to conform to\nOHRP’s previous interpretation of public benefit and service programs that are\nbeing evaluated as part of the research. This interpretation includes public benefit\nor service programs that a Common Rule department or agency does not itself\nadminister or conduct through its own employees or agents, but rather supports\nthrough a grant or contract program. Therefore, the exemption applies to research\nand demonstration projects supported through, for example, federal grants or\ncooperative agreements. These changes would bring the regulatory language into\nconformance with other provisions of the rule that refer to research “conducted or\nsupported” by federal departments and agencies. These methods of\nadministration are, of course, always subject to department or agency head\napproval, either directly or by delegation. In addition, some of these research and\ndemonstration projects are conducted through waivers, interagency agreements,\nor other methods that also require agency head approval. Accordingly, both the\nprevious and revised language allow for the full panoply of methods by which\nresearch and demonstration projects on public benefit or service programs can be\ncarried out.\nThe wording of the exemption also is clarified to specifically include projects\ninvolving waivers of otherwise mandatory requirements using authorities such as\nsections 1115 and 1115A of the Social Security Act, in order to make it plain that\nsuch research projects on public benefit or service programs qualify for the\nexemption. The relevant sections of the Social Security Act were also cited when\nthis exemption was published in 1983.\nIn the interest of transparency, as was proposed in the NPRM, the final rule\nrequires that each federal department or agency conducting or supporting the\nresearch and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly accessible\nfederal website or in such other manner as the department or agency head may\ndetermine, a list of the research and demonstration projects the federal\ndepartment or agency conducts or supports under this provision. The research or\ndemonstration project must be published on this list before beginning the\nresearch involving human subjects. The department or agency head can\ndetermine what sort of information will be included on this list and maintains its\noversight. Departments and agencies that already publish research and\ndemonstration projects on a publicly accessible website could satisfy this\nproposed requirement if the existing website includes a statement indicating\nwhich of the studies were determined to meet this exemption.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 61/121The goal of this proposed requirement is to promote transparency of federally\nconducted or supported activities a\u0000ecting the public that are not subject to\noversight under the Common Rule. It should not cause any delay to the research.\nHHS will develop a resource that all Common Rule departments and agencies may\nuse to satisfy the requirement at §__.104(d)(5)(i). Alternatively, an agency can\ncreate or modify its own website for this purpose.\nThe exemption is not modified to require notice, to apply only to minimal risk\nresearch activities, or to require the privacy safeguards, for reasons reflected in\nthe public comments. We agree with the public comments that argued that in\nmany cases notice would be di\u0000icult or impossible to achieve e\u0000ectively, and that\nthis exemption enables the Federal Government to conduct important evaluations\nof its own programs that provide significant benefits to the public. In addition,\nfederal departments and agencies are already subject to other laws and policies\nthat protect the interests of research subjects (e.g., the Privacy Act).\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

This exemption applies if wholesome foods without\nadditives are consumed, or if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient\nat or below the level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural, chemical or\nenvironmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe by FDA or\napproved by the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food Safety and\nInspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Secondary research under\nthis exemption would generally be conducted with the information or\nbiospecimens stored and maintained under the exemption at §__.104(d)(7).\nBoth of these exemptions for the secondary use of identifiable private information\nand identifiable biospecimens require broad consent and are discussed in detail\nbelow.

These exemptions do not\ncover any primary collections of either information or biospecimens. In other\nwords, if an investigator wants to collect information directly from research\nsubjects, for example, by asking them to complete a questionnaire, that would not\nbe covered by these exemptions.

It\nrequires that an IRB conduct limited IRB review to make the following\ndeterminations (required by §__.111(a)(8)):10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 64/121Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in\naccordance with the requirements of §__.116(a)(1)-(4), and (a)(6), and (d);\nBroad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is\nappropriate, in accordance with §__.117; and\nIf a change is made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private\ninformation or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, adequate\nprovisions must be in place to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain\nthe confidentiality of data.\nThis exemption is similar to the exemption proposed in the NPRM at §__.104(f)(1),\nbut it has been modified in some respects, and the operation of this exemption is\nalso a\u0000ected by other changes in the final rule that are di\u0000erent from the NPRM.\nNamely, the exemption has been modified to apply only to storage or\nmaintenance for secondary research use of identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens, because the final rule does not incorporate the NPRM\nproposal to alter the definition of a human subject to extend to research involving\nbiospecimens regardless of their identifiability. This exemption was also modified\ngiven the decision not to adopt the privacy safeguards proposed in the NPRM at\n§__.105.\nIn addition, the Secretary’s template for broad consent is not being finalized for\nthis exemption. Instead, institutions will have the flexibility to create their own\nconsent forms that satisfy requirements at §__.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6) and (d) (see\nSection XIV [of the final rule preamble]). The consent form may be electronic.\nGiven these changes from the NPRM proposal, the limited IRB review requirement\nfor this exemption provided at §__.111(a)(8) has been expanded in the final rule to\nrequire that the IRB make the following determinations, some of which are similar\nto those proposed in the NPRM.\nThe final rule requires that for the exemption to apply, the IRB must determine\nthat broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in\naccordance with the requirements of §__.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d); This\nincludes the requirement proposed in the NPRM that there be IRB review of the\nprocess through which broad consent will be obtained.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 65/121Also, given that we are not finalizing the proposed requirement to use the\nSecretary’s template for broad consent, the final rule includes in this requirement\nthat an IRB determine that the broad consent includes the requirements and\nelements of consent in accordance with §__.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d).\nThe final rule also requires that the IRB determine that broad consent is\nappropriately documented or waived in accordance with §__.117. Although\nwritten broad consent generally will be required for this exemption to apply, the\nfinal rule also permits the exemption to apply when broad consent is obtained\nand an IRB has waived the documentation requirement for written informed\nconsent under §__.117(c)(1).\nAnd because the proposed privacy safeguards proposed in the NPRM at §__.105\nare not included in the final rule, if a change will be made for research purposes in\nthe way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are\nstored or maintained, the IRB must determine that when appropriate, adequate\nprovisions are in place to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the\nconfidentiality of data. This is the same IRB determination related to privacy and\nconfidentiality that is required for nonexempt research. Importantly, this IRB\ndetermination is required only when a change is made for research purposes in\nthe way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are\nstored or maintained, and only pertains to the aspects of storage and\nmaintenance that are changed for research purposes. In this circumstance, the\ninvestigators are assuming responsibility for the manner in which the information\nand biospecimens are stored and maintained, and the IRB should be required to\nensure that appropriate protections for the subjects are place with regard to the\naspects of storage or maintenance that were changed for research purposes.\nIf, on the other hand, no changes are being made for research purposes to the\nstorage or maintenance, then this IRB determination does not apply. The\ninstitution storing and maintaining the information or biospecimens of course still\nhas its responsibility to determine what protections distinct from those required\nby the Common Rule are appropriate, which may include other legal or regulatory\nsafeguards or institutional policies. In light of application of such additional\nsafeguards, it appears unnecessary to require additional protections through a\nrequirement of this final rule simply because the individuals providing broad\nconsent have agreed that their biospecimens or information could be used for10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 66/121research at some point in the future. And of course this provision regarding\nchanges made for research purposes applies only when a Common Rule\ndepartment or agency supports or conducts the research activity.\nNote that in many instances the only change that results from a person having\nsigned a broad consent form for research relating to storing and maintaining that\nperson’s biospecimens or information is that the institution that is already holding\nthe biospecimens or information (for clinical purposes, for example) merely\ncreates a record indicating that this person has signed such a consent form. The\nbiospecimens and information could remain stored in whatever way (and for\nwhatever period of time) that the institution had previously been storing them,\nbased on the legitimate nonresearch or research-related reasons that the\ninstitution has used for initially collecting and storing those biospecimens and\ninformation. Any privacy and security protections (outside of the Common Rule)\nthat already may apply to the institution’s information record-keeping or\nbiospecimen preservation activities would continue to apply. The Common Rule’s\nprotections would not apply before a change in storage or maintenance occurs for\nresearch purposes, but rather the institution would continue to operate in\naccordance with its pre-existing legitimate reasons for having and storing the\nbiospecimens and information. The fact that the broad consent form has been\nsigned does not by itself mean that there needs to be any alteration of what the\ninstitution is already doing with the biospecimens or information.\nExamples of changed aspects of storage or maintenance for research purposes\nthat would require the IRB to find, before those changes go into e\u0000ect, whether\nthere are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and maintain the\nconfidentiality of data include the following: if information or biospecimens are\nmoved from one electronic or physical storage location to another due to\nconsiderations related to research plans; if information or biospecimens will be\nstored for longer than they otherwise would have been for the original purpose; if\ninformation or biospecimens are placed in a research registry or repository\ncreated to serve as a resource for investigators; or investigators are given\nelectronic or physical access to the information or biospecimens. The relevant\nchanges do not necessarily involve moving information or biospecimens from one\nlocation to another. Rather, the relevant changes include any change for research\npurposes that introduces or alters risks to the privacy or security of the stored10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 67/121information or biospecimens, including giving access to or transferring\ninformation or biospecimens for research purposes to someone who otherwise\nwould not have access.\nThe rationale for this exemption is that with the requirement for limited IRB\nreview and the specified required IRB determinations, including subjects’ broad\nconsent, this exemption respects subjects’ autonomy and provides appropriate\nprivacy safeguards. More specifically, we believe that broad consent provides\nsome measure of autonomy for individuals to decide whether to allow the\nresearch use of their identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens,\nwithout imposing the kind of burden on investigators that would result from a\nrequirement for specific informed consent for each secondary research study. We\nbelieve that it is appropriate to create a mechanism for broad consent for\nsecondary research use, even if it involves the potential risk of having identifiers\nassociated with the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.\nWe believe the administrative burden is also acceptable in order to allow for broad\nconsent for secondary research use.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

The exemption at §__.104(d)(8) would apply to a specific\nsecondary research study, provided that the following criteria are met:\nBroad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of\nthe identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens was obtained\nin accordance with §__.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);\nDocumentation of informed consent or waiver of documentation of consent\nwas obtained in accordance with §__.117;\nAn IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by\n§__.111(a)(7), and to make the determination that the research to be\nconducted is within the scope of the broad consent; and\nThe investigator does not include returning individual research results to\nsubjects as part of the study plan. However, it is permissible under this\nexemption to return individual research results when required by law\nregardless of whether or not such return is described in the study plan.\nThis exemption could also apply if the investigator obtains appropriate broad\nconsent from the subject in addition to the consent to an original specific study,\nand then proceeds to use the information or biospecimen in a secondary study.\nThe exemption at §__.104(d)(8) is similar to the exemption proposed in the NPRM ,\nbut it has been modified in some respects. As with the exemption at §__.104(d)(7),\nthe operation of the exemption at §__.104(d)(8) is also a\u0000ected by other\nprovisions in the final rule that are di\u0000erent from what was proposed in the NPRM.\nNamely, the exemption has been modified to apply only to storage or\nmaintenance for secondary research use of identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens because the final rule does not incorporate the NPRM\nproposal to alter the definition of a human subject to extend to research involving\nbiospecimens regardless of their identifiability.\nDue to the decision not to adopt the proposed privacy and security safeguards\nproposed in the NPRM at §__.105, this exemption was also modified to require\nthat limited IRB review include an IRB determination that, when appropriate,\nadequate provisions are in place to protect the privacy of subjects and the\nconfidentiality of data (§__.111(a)(7)). This is the same IRB approval criteria\nrelated to privacy and confidentiality that is required for nonexempt human\nsubjects research.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 69/121In addition, because the final rule does not include a broad consent template\nwhen a specific study has been proposed, it is required that the study be reviewed\nby an IRB to determine whether the proposed secondary analysis fits within the\nparameters of the broad consent that was obtained for secondary research use.\nWe believe that the final rule’s requirement for limited IRB review of the privacy\nand confidentiality protections and the adequacy of the broad consent is\nresponsive to commenters who believe that IRB oversight should be retained for\nthe secondary research use of identifiable private information and identifiable\nbiospecimens.\nWe recognize commenters’ point that this exemption does not provide an\nincentive to investigators to provide individual research results to subjects, but we\nbelieve that the challenges of how and when to return such results warrant\nconsultation with the IRB. We note that with the other revisions to the NPRM\nproposals, other options for research involving identifiable private information\nand identifiable biospecimens exist, which would be consistent with having plans\nfor returning individual results. Although broad consent may include a statement\nthat clinically relevant research results might be returned to subjects, we believe\nthat when specific secondary studies include such a plan to return research\nresults, it would almost always be appropriate for the study to be reviewed by an\nIRB, in part to better ensure that research results are disclosed to subjects in an\nappropriate manner. The only exceptions would be if the research qualified for\nanother exemption, an IRB waived informed consent under §__.116(e) or (f), or\nthe research was carried out under a Secretarial waiver at §__.101(i). We expect\nthat as part of the IRB’s review, the IRB would consider what subjects were told in\nthe broad consent regarding the return of research results.\nIt should be noted that the two exemptions in the final rule at §__.104(d)(7) and\n(8) create additional options for investigators to conduct secondary research\nstudies with identifiable private information.

Approximately 100 comments\ndiscussed this proposed deletion and it was almost universally opposed. Political\nscience professors, students, researchers, and academics from other disciplines\ngenerally addressed this deletion.\nComments argued that this deletion would have a chilling e\u0000ect on political\nscience research and might make political science researchers more vulnerable to\nlaw suits. Other comments noted that public o\u0000icials are generally treated\ndi\u0000erently in numerous laws, and it is in fact appropriate for the Common Rule to\nhave a di\u0000erent standard for surveys and interviews with public o\u0000icials.\nComments also suggested that this deletion could negatively a\u0000ect the public’s\nability to hold public o\u0000icials accountable for their actions. One commenter\nsuggested that instead of deleting this exemption, a final rule might consider\nexplicitly limiting this exemption to studies that relate to the public o\u0000icials in\ntheir o\u0000icial capacity.\nThe final rule removes the exemption category in the pre-2018 rule at §__.101(b)\n(3)(i), which pertained to research involving the use of educational tests, survey\nprocedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior, if the human\nsubjects are elected or appointed public o\u0000icials or candidates for public o\u0000ice, or\nif federal statute requires without exception that the confidentiality of the\npersonally identifiable information will be maintained throughout the research\nand therea\u0000er.

Almost all of the research activities in this\ncategory would already be exempted under the final rule at §__.104(d)(2), without\nneeding to single out elected or appointed o\u0000icials as being treated di\u0000erently in\nthis way. If the research is designed to provide sensitive generalizable knowledge\nabout o\u0000icials, then the identifiable private information obtained should be kept\nconfidential as required by this final rule. If the purpose of the activity is in fact\ndesigned to hold specific elected or appointed o\u0000icials up for public scrutiny, and\nnot keep the information confidential, such an activity is not considered research\nunder the provision at §__.102(l)(2).\nThus, the final rule adopts the NPRM proposal.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

Note that\nexclusions proposed in the NPRM and not included in the final rule also are\ndescribed in Section III.I.4 of [the final rule] preamble.\nThe NPRM proposed to exempt certain secondary research activities involving\nidentifiable private information where notice of such use had been given. The\nproposed exemption was included, in part, to be responsive to section 511 of the\nMedicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which requires\nthe Secretary to issue a clarification or modification with respect to the\napplication of these regulations to certain activities involving clinical data10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 72/121registries. The preamble for the Common Rule NPRM noted \"...this exemption\ncategory might allow certain research activities of these clinical data registries not\notherwise covered by the proposed HIPAA-related exclusion (i.e., when the clinical\ndata registries are not part of a HIPAA covered entity or acting as a business\nassociate), such as when a clinical data registry may receive information from a\nhealth care entity for research purposes.\"\nThe NPRM included the exemption at §__.104(e)(2), in part, to be responsive to\nsection 511 of MACRA, but commenters expressed little support for this\nexemption, even for activities carried out by clinical data registries. Section 511 of\nMACRA has directed the Secretary of HHS to issue a clarification or modification\nwith respect to the application of the Common Rule to activities involving clinical\ndata registries, including quality improvement activities. With this final rule,\nthe Secretary of HHS is providing that clarification here. Because clinical data\nregistries are created for a variety of purposes, and are designed and used in\ndi\u0000erent ways, there is no simple, single answer regarding how the Common Rule\napplies to clinical data registries. The Secretary of HHS has received advice from\nSACHRP on this topic, and SACHRP recommended that the pre-2018 rule was\nadequate to apply to clinical data registries without those registries being given\nany distinctive status. The Secretary of HHS believes that the same is true for the\nfinal rule, and so has not created a specific provision for clinical data registries.\nThe final rule does not impose any requirements on a large portion of the\nactivities related to clinical data registries. The following points are important:\nFirst, the rule does not apply to clinical data registry activities not conducted or\nsupported by a Common Rule department or agency. Second, many clinical data\nregistry activities, including many quality improvement activities, do not meet the\ndefinition of research, and so the Common Rule does not apply. For example, the\ncreation of a clinical data registry designed to provide information about the\nperformance quality of institutional care providers, and whose design is not\ninfluenced or altered to facilitate research, is not covered by this rule even if it is\nknown that the registry will be used for research studies. Third, the Common Rule\ndoes not apply to a clinical data registry research study that only involves\nobtaining and analyzing nonidentified information because that activity would\nnot involve a “human subject” as defined by the rule. Fourth, some clinical data\nregistry research activities may qualify for exemption under the proposed\nprovision at §__.104(d). Fi\u0000h, if an institution solely releases identifiable private\ninformation that was obtained in the course of patient clinical care to a clinical10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 73/121data registry for research, that institution is considered to be not engaged in\nhuman subjects research, and no requirements of the rule apply to that\ninstitution.\nIn contrast, if investigators receive funding from a Common Rule department or\nagency to design a clinical data registry for research purposes and the registry\nincludes identifiable private information, or involves interacting with individuals\n(e.g., a research survey), then such an activity involves human subjects research,\nbut may be exempt if it meets one or more of the exemption categories under\n§__.104(d)(7). Similarly, if investigators use federal support to obtain identifiable\nprivate information from a clinical data registry to conduct a research study, then\nsuch secondary research use of clinical registry information would involve human\nsubjects research and the requirements of the rule would apply, although the\nresearch may qualify for exemption under §__.104(d)(8). This is comparable to\nhow the rule applies to a research study that involves chart review of identifiable\nprivate information drawn directly from hospital medical records.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

To\nbetter ensure that appropriate privacy protections are required by IRBs, the final\nrule includes a new provision in the IRB review and approval criteria at §__.111(a)\n(7)(i) that requires the Secretary of HHS in consultation with OMB and the10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 74/121Common Rule departments and agencies to issue guidance o assist IRBs in\nassessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to\nmaintain the confidentiality of data. This requirement is discussed in more detail\nin Section XI [of the final rule preamble].\nAlthough we continue to believe that appropriately protecting the privacy of\nhuman subjects who provide identifiable private information and identifiable\nbiospecimens as well as preventing security breaches is critically important, we\nagree with the public’s concerns about requiring adherence to privacy and\nsecurity standards when the safeguards to be issued by the Secretary of HHS have\nyet to be developed. The federal privacy and security laws would apply only to\ncertain federally conducted research. Rather than promulgate a regulation that\nlacked su\u0000icient specificity, we determined it would be preferable to maintain the\nrequirement that IRBs review research studies to ensure that appropriate privacy\nand security safeguards are in place to protect research subjects, but include a\ncommitment that the Secretary of HHS will issue guidance to assist IRBs in\nappropriately protecting subjects’ privacy and confidentiality. This guidance\nwould take into consideration, among other things, the level of identifiability and\nsensitivity of the information being collected. Although IRBs were not specifically\ndesigned to evaluate risk to privacy and confidentiality and the adequacy of\nsafeguards to protect against those risks, IRBs have been responsible for\nevaluating such risks under the pre-2018 rule. We believe that guidance in this\ncomplex and evolving area will assist IRBs to identify appropriate protections, and\nmay be better able than standardized protections, to address the variety of\nprivacy and confidentiality concerns that arise in the broad range of research\nstudies that are being carried out now and those that will be conducted in the\nyears to come.\nAs discussed in [the final rule preamble], certain NPRM exemption proposals\nrequired the application of the NPRM’s proposed safeguards in whole or in part.\nTo accommodate the fact that the final rule does not include the privacy\nsafeguards, exemption categories in the final rule that are predicated on the need\nfor some type of privacy safeguards will instead require that an IRB conduct a\nlimited review to ensure that adequate provisions are in place to protect the\nprivacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.\nThe final rule exemptions subject to this limited IRB review requirement are:10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 75/121The exemption for research that includes only interactions involving\neducational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures, or observations of\npublic behavior regardless of the identifiability or sensitivity of the\ninformation collected/ recorded (§__.104(d)(2)(iii));\nThe exemption for research involving benign behavioral interventions in\nconjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through\nverbal or written responses or video recording (regardless of the identifiability\nor sensitivity of the information collected/ recorded (§__.104(d)(3)(i)(C));\nThe exemption for the storage or maintenance of identifiable private\ninformation or identifiable biospecimens for which broad consent is required,\nwhen there is a change specific to the research activity in how the identifiable\nprivate information or identifiable biospecimens are stored and maintained\n(§__.104(d)(7)); and\nThe exemption for the secondary research use of identifiable private\ninformation or identified biospecimens for which broad consent is required\n(§__.104(d)(8))\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

For studies\ninitially reviewed by a convened IRB, once certain specified procedures are all that\nremain for the study, continuing review would not be required, unless specifically\nmandated by the IRB.

Institutions that choose to\nrequire some accounting of ongoing research not subject to continuing review\nhave significant flexibility in how they implement their own requirements.

Thus, we anticipate that more studies that\ninvolve no more than minimal risk will undergo expedited review, rather than full\nreview, which will relieve burden on IRBs.\nFurther, IRBs will be required to document their rationale when they override the\npresumption that studies on the Secretary’s expedited review list involve greater\nthan minimal risk (at §__.115(a)(8)). Although public comments argued that this\ndocumentation represented an unjustified burden on IRBs, we believe that such\ndocumentation could provide a basis for the Secretary’s future determinations\nabout the appropriateness of the list, and allow for greater consistency across\ninstitutions, and thus make the Common Rule more just.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 79/121At §__.110(b)(1)(iii) the final rule adopts the NPRM proposal that an IRB may use\nthe expedited review process when conducting limited IRB review as required by\nthe exemptions at §__.104(d)(2)(iii), §__.104(d)(3)(i)(C), §__.104(d)(7), and\n§__.104(d)(8).\nFinally, as proposed in the NRPM, evaluation of the list of expedited review\ncategories will occur every 8 years, followed by publication in the Federal Register\nand solicitation of public comment.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

It does not include the\nNPRM proposal regarding IRB review of plans to review the return of clinically\nrelevant results to subjects. This proposal was deleted due to concern over the\ncriteria that would be required for an IRB to appropriately consider this area, the\nneed for particular IRB expertise to appropriately assess the return of results, and\nambiguity over the meaning of “clinically relevant.”\nThe final rule does, however, revise two of the existing criteria for approval of\nresearch: (1) special considerations related to the involvement of vulnerable\npopulations, and (2) privacy and confidentiality of data provisions.\nAs discussed in more detail in Section VII [of the final rule preamble], the language\nregarding vulnerable populations at §__.111(a)(3) and (b) has been revised to\nreflect the current understanding of which populations should receive special\nconsideration due to potential vulnerabilities specific to the purposes and context\nof human subjects studies and to parallel other references to vulnerable\npopulations found at §__.107(a).10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 80/121Section __.111(a)(7) in the final rule retains the pre-2018 language, but also adds\nan additional requirement, thereby serving a dual function as both the primary\nregulatory provision requiring IRB review of the adequacy of protections for the\nprivacy of subjects and confidentiality of identifiable private information\n(including that obtained from the analysis of biospecimens), and as the primary\nlimited IRB review requirement needed to satisfy certain exemption\ndeterminations in §__.104(d).\nIn §__.111(a)(7)(i) the Secretary of HHS commits to issuing guidance to assist IRBs\nin assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to\nmaintain the confidentiality of information, a\u0000er consultation with OMB’s privacy\no\u0000ice and other federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy.\nThis modification is intended to serve a similar function as the privacy safeguards\nproposed in the NPRM (but not adopted in the final rule). The guidance might\naddress the following considerations such as:\nThe extent to which identifiable private information is or has been de-\nidentified and the risk that such de-identified information can be re-identified;\nThe use of the information;\nThe extent to which the information will be shared or transferred to a third\nparty or otherwise disclosed or released;\nThe likely retention period or life of the information;\nThe security controls that are in place to protect the confidentiality and\nintegrity of the information; and\nThe potential risk of harm to individuals should the information be lost, stolen,\ncompromised, or otherwise used in a way contrary to the contours of the\nresearch under the exemption.\nThe final rule at §__.111(a)(8) modifies the NPRM proposal on the limited IRB\nreview required by §__.104(d)(7). Section __.111(a)(8) specifies that for the\npurposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by §__.104(d)(7), the IRB\nmust determine that broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary\nresearch use of identifiable biospecimens or identifiable private information is\nobtained in accordance with the requirements of §__.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d).\nAs part of its review of these requirements for broad consent, the IRB would\nreview the appropriateness of the process proposed for obtaining broad consent,\nand ensure that the required elements of broad consent were appropriately\nincluded in the broad consent form (or process, if broad consent is to be obtained10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 81/121orally). Additionally, the IRB must determine that consent is appropriately\ndocumented, or that a waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance\nwith §__.117. Finally, if a change is made for research purposes in the way\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or\nmaintained, the IRB must determine that adequate provisions are in place to\nprotect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. It is\nexpected that the guidance to be developed by the Secretary of HHS about\nprotecting the privacy of subjects and maintaining the confidentiality of data will\nalso be applicable to the privacy and confidentiality considerations included in\nthis limited IRB review requirement.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

We agree with commenters who speculated that mandated\nsingle IRB review would ultimately decrease administrative burdens and\nine\u0000iciencies for investigators and institutions, while acknowledging that the\ntransition to this model would require significant time and an adjustment to\ninstitutional structures and policies. We concur that, rather than o\u0000ering\nadditional protections, in many cases multiple IRB approvals increase burden and\nfrequently delay the implementation of studies, increasing the costs of clinical\ntrials and potentially stalling access to new therapies. We note comments that\nexpressed frustration with the frequent occurrence of central IRB participating\nsites insisting on separate institutional reviews. One comment noted that these\nadditional IRB reviews generally reach the same conclusions, or conclusions with\nminor changes, that are then imposed solely on that site. When working optimally,\nwe expect the central IRB model will work more e\u0000iciently and require less\npersonnel time and fewer resources for tracking and implementing IRB changes10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 82/121and approvals, thereby eliminating the potential for unnecessarily duplicative\nreviews.\n \nAlthough a large number of comments believed that single IRB review should be\nencouraged rather than mandated, we feel that this incentivized approach would\nultimately fail to yield substantive positive change in the system. Rather,\nsystematic e\u0000iciencies have the best chance of occurring if single IRB review is\nrequired for all review in domestic research involving more than one institution.\nWe acknowledge that further guidance for this requirement will need to be\ndeveloped and that initial cost projections may have been low. However, we feel\nthis change supports the best interests of the research infrastructure through\nincreasing e\u0000iciency. Note that the final rule permits appropriate flexibilities that\nwill assist in implementation. Institutions may still choose to conduct additional\ninternal IRB reviews for their own purposes, though such reviews would no longer\nhave any regulatory status in terms of compliance with the Common Rule.\nWe agree with comments recommending that a greater role should be provided\nfor grantee input on choosing the IRB of record, and have modified the language\naccordingly. The language at §__.114(b)(1) now states that the reviewing IRB (i.e.,\nthe IRB of record) will be identified by the federal department or agency\nsupporting or conducting the research, yet allows lead institutions to propose the\nreviewing IRB, subject to the acceptance of the federal department or agency\nsupporting the research. This provision is consistent with the NIH single IRB\npolicy, which was published on June 21, 2016.\nThis final rule adopts (in §__.114(b)(2)(i)) the NPRM’s proposal that cooperative\nresearch for which more than single IRB review is required by law is not subject to\nthe requirements of §__.114. The rule also adds clarifying language providing that\nthis provision extends to tribal laws passed by the o\u0000icial governing body of an\nAI/AN tribe. Thus, if the o\u0000icial governing body of an AI/AN tribe passes a tribal law\nthat requires more than single IRB review for certain cooperative research, the\nrequirement for single IRB review does not apply to such cooperative research. In\naddition, we highlight that §__.114(b)(2)(ii) allows a federal department or agency\nthe flexibility to determine that the use of a single IRB is not appropriate for\ncertain contexts, thereby permitting additional IRB review and consideration of\nlocal and regional variations in some circumstances.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 83/121Finally, the final rule adopts the NPRM proposal for this provision to have a\ndelayed compliance date of 3-years from the date the final rule is published in the\nFederal Register.

However, the final rule di\u0000ers from the NPRM in a\nfew ways. First, the NPRM included two provisions requiring documentation of\ncontinuing review activities; these have been merged into one provision in the\nfinal rule at §__.115(a)(3). Second, the NPRM required that the IRB keep records of\nthe IRB reliance agreements between an institution and the IRBs not operated by\nthat institution that review said institution’s nonexempt research activities.\nInstead, the final rule includes language at §__.115(a)(9) that requires each\ninstitution to maintain adequate documentation of the responsibilities that each\nentity will undertake to ensure compliance with this policy. This provision di\u0000ers\nfrom the NPRM proposal to correspond to the more flexible provision included at\n§__.103(e), which does not require the creation of a written agreement between\nan institution and a reviewing IRB that said institution does not operate.\nBecause the final rule does not include an exemption determination requirement,\nthe exemption documentation requirement proposed in the NPRM is not included\nin the final rule. Additionally, because the final rule does not include specified\nprivacy safeguards, the NPRM proposal for an IRB to safeguard records as required\nby the proposed privacy safeguards is not included.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 84/121The final rule includes the NPRM proposal that IRBs document decisions to\nrequire continuing review or full board review even in circumstances when such\nreview is not required because we believe it is important to document why an IRB\nis making a determination that di\u0000ers from the regulatory baseline. This also\nhelps to promote the principle of justice (as applied to IRB operations). Note that\nnothing in these regulations prevents an institution from authorizing an IRB to\napply standards that exceed those in the regulations, if indeed the institution has\nchosen to do so.\nIn addition, while the NPRM proposed to require that IRB records that contain\nidentifiable private information be safeguarded through compliance with the\nproposed privacy safeguards, the final rule does not require such safeguards.\nAlthough no public comments were received on this provision, in deciding not to\ninclude the NPRM’s proposed privacy safeguard requirements in the final rule, we\ndetermined that it was unnecessary for the Common Rule to impose additional\nprivacy requirements on IRB records as we are unaware of instances in which IRB\nrecords were breached. In addition, IRB records are not the regulatory equivalent\nof research records, which should be adequately secured or safeguarded against\ninappropriate uses or disclosures of identifiable private information. IRB records\nwill generally be secured for a variety of reasons. These include not only\nprotecting identifiable private information, but also, for example, protecting\ndiscrete information and intellectual property that might be included in a\nprotocol. There are other means for ensuring institutions and IRBs protect their\nrecords beyond what is required by the Common Rule.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

In the pre-2018\nrule, the general requirements were included in an unnumbered introductory10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 86/121paragraph. The NPRM proposed the same approach. To emphasize the fact that\nthis paragraph includes multiple independent and important regulatory\nrequirements, and to enable stakeholders and Common Rule departments and\nagencies to more easily reference particular requirements, these general\nrequirements have been redesignated into a new §__.116(a). In addition, the\ngeneral requirement for consent in the final rule at §__.116(a)(6) removes the\nreference to oral or written consent that was in the pre-2018 rule. This is the\nprovision that addresses the prohibition on including exculpatory language\nthrough which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to\nwaive or appear to waive any of the subject’s legal rights, or releases or appears to\nrelease the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for\nnegligence. The reference to oral or written consent was removed from this\nprovision in the final rule. In its place, a similar reference was included in to\n§__.116(a) to clarify that all the requirements set forth in §__.116(a) apply to\nwritten and oral consent.\nAnother change made in the final rule, as compared with the pre-2018 rule and\nthe language proposed in the NPRM, is that §__.116(a) contains introductory\nlanguage summarizing each paragraph of §__.116 and the relationship between\nthose paragraphs. Given that the framework for informed consent has been\naltered and reorganized through this regulation, this introductory language is\nintended to explain the overall approach set forth in revised §__.116, as well as\nthe significance of each paragraph. This introductory language is also intended to\nexplain the role of broad consent under revised §__.116. The introductory\nparagraph explains that the general requirements for informed consent are now\nset forth in §__.116(a) and that these general requirements apply with respect to\ninformed consent obtained pursuant to §__.116(b), (c), and (d) (except, as\ndescribed later, §__.116(a)(5) does not apply to broad consent obtained under\n§__.116(d)). This introductory language also explains that the basic elements of\ninformed consent (which were described in §__.116(a) of the pre-2018 rule) are\nincluded in §__.116(b) of this final rule and that additional elements of informed\nconsent that pertain only to certain studies (which were described in §__.116(b) of\nthe pre-2018 rule) are included in §__.116(c) of this final rule.\nIn addition, this introductory language explains that the requirements for broad\nconsent (a concept not specifically addressed in the pre-2018 rule) are described\nin §__.116(d) of this final rule. As discussed below, broad consent under this final\nrule di\u0000ers from the broad consent approach proposed for §__.116(c) in the10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 87/121NPRM. The introductory language of §__.116(a) explains that broad consent may\nbe obtained in lieu of informed consent obtained under §__.116(b) and §__.116(c)\n(which describe basic elements of informed consent as a general matter and\nadditional elements of informed consent that apply only to certain studies,\nrespectively) for certain purposes. Specifically, in lieu of obtaining study-specific\ninformed consent in accordance with §__.116(b) and (c), broad consent may be\nobtained under §__.116(d) for the use of identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens collected for either research studies other than the\nproposed research or nonresearch purposes for: (1) storage and maintenance for\nsecondary research use; and (2) secondary research. For those purposes (and no\nothers), broad consent under §__.116(d) may be obtained instead of specific\nconsent under §__.116(b) and (c).\nNew introductory language at §__.116(a) also summarizes the provisions\ndescribing circumstances in which waiver or alteration of the requirements of\ninformed consent are permitted. These circumstances pertain to research\ninvolving public benefit and service programs conducted by or subject to the\napproval of state or local o\u0000icials at §__.116(e), and to research more generally at\n§__.116(f) (see below).\nAnother change reflected in the final rule is that specific requirements for\ninformed consent have been included in subparagraphs for clarity and emphasis.\nFor example, the requirement that information that is given to the subject or the\nlegally authorized representative shall be in language understandable to such\nsubject or representative is no longer included as part of a general introductory\nparagraph and is instead included as §__.116(a)(3). Except as noted here, these\nrequirements remain the same as they were under the pre-2018 rule.\nThe final rule adopts, almost verbatim, all of the proposals made in the NPRM to\nimprove and clarify the general requirements for informed consent. For example,\nthe final rule adopts the proposed requirement specifying that the information\nprovided in an informed consent form must be presented in su\u0000icient detail\nrelating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does\nnot merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective\nsubject’s or legally authorized representative’s understanding of the reasons why\none might or might not want to participate. The final rule also adopts new\nlanguage clarifying that this requirement applies to the informed consent as a\nwhole. In addition, the final rule adopts the NPRM’s proposal that prospective\nsubjects or legally authorized representative must be provided with key10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 88/121information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized\nrepresentative in making a decision about participating in research, and to\nprovide an opportunity to discuss that information. Moreover, the final rule\nadopts an approach, consistent with many public comments, emphasizing e\u0000orts\nto foster understanding overall rather than imposing specific length limitations on\nthe entire consent forms.\nThe final rule also includes language slightly di\u0000erent from that proposed in the\nNPRM for clarity or for conformance with other language in the final rule. For\nexample, the final rule replaces references to a subject’s representative with\nreferences to a subject’s legally authorized representative (a term defined in\n§__.102) for clarity.\nAs discussed above, a significant proposal in the NPRM was that in obtaining\ninformed consent, investigators would first have to present the information\nrequired by §__.116, before presenting any other information, if any. In addition,\nthe NPRM proposed mandating that consent forms must include only the required\ninformation under §__.116 and that any other information be included in\nappendices. The final rule does not adopt a requirement that certain information\nbe included only in appendices. This approach is responsive to public comments\nexpressing concerns that such a mandate might sometimes undermine the\ninformed consent process. The final rule adopts a slight variation of that approach\nin response to public comments about perceived lack of flexibility in the proposed\nlanguage. Whereas the NPRM referred to the “body” of the consent form as\nopposed to appendices to the consent form, the final rule replaces those concepts\nwith references to material that must be at the beginning of the consent form,\nversus material that can appear a\u0000er that beginning section. The final rule does\nnot limit the information that can be provided in the beginning of a consent form\nto only the §__.116 requirements, but instead o\u0000ers a more flexible and\nmeaningful approach in response to public concerns that the NPRM proposal was\ntoo prescriptive. Moreover, the approach recognizes public comments that\nexpressed concerns about creating a “dual document” system. As such, the final\nrule does not address appendices to the informed consent. However, the NPRM’s\nreferences to the appendices of the consent form have in general been\nconceptually replaced by references to the material in a consent form that follows\nthe “beginning” section.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 89/121In particular, the final rule imposes a new requirement (set forth in §__.116(a)(5)\n(i)) that the informed consent begin with a concise and focused presentation of\nthe key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally\nauthorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might\nnot want to participate in the research. This provision further requires that this\nbeginning portion of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a\nway that facilitates comprehension. This requirement applies to all informed\nconsents, except for broad consents obtained pursuant to §__.116(d), which may\nwarrant a di\u0000erent presentation.\nThis new requirement included at §__.116(a)(5)(i) is somewhat similar to the\nproposal advanced in the NPRM insofar as both emphasize the importance of\npresenting the information that would be most important to a subject (or a legally\nauthorized representative) before presenting other information. However, the\nrequirement included in §__.116(a)(5)(i) is more specific, detailed, and flexible.\nFirst, this provision requires that key information be included in the beginning of\nthe informed consent in a concise and focused presentation. We recognize that\nhow this requirement applies will depend on the nature of the specific research\nstudy and the information presented in the informed consent and believe that this\nrequirement strikes an appropriate balance between facilitating the\ncomprehension of subjects of key issues and allowing study-specific flexibilities.\nIn general, our expectation is that this initial presentation of the key pieces of\ninformation will be relatively short. This section of the consent could, in\nappropriate circumstances, include a summary of relevant pieces of information\nthat are explained in greater detail later in the consent form.\nThe requirement that key information be presented in a concise and focused way\nwill require an assessment that is specific to a study and its informed consent. For\nexample, for most complicated clinical trials involving cancer patients with long\n(e.g., 20- to 25-page) consent documents, our expectation would be that the\nconcise and focused presentation referred to in §__.116(a)(5)(i) would be no more\nthan a few pages, and would provide the key pieces of information about the trial\nin such a manner that facilitates a person’s comprehension of why they might or\nmight not want to participate in the research.\nIn such cases, for example, we would not consider a 10-page description of\nelements such as potential risks, accompanied by lengthy and complex charts and\ngraphs, to satisfy the “concise and focused” requirement of §__.116(a)(5)(i). With\nregard to risks in the type of cancer trial mentioned above, for example, instead of10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 90/121needing to mention every reasonably foreseeable risk, which would be required\nby §__.116(b)(2), this beginning section of the consent form should identify the\nmost important risks, similar to the information that a doctor might deliver in the\nclinical context in telling a patient how sick the chemotherapy drugs will make\nthem, but with a particular emphasis on how those risks are changed by\nparticipating in the study.\nWe recognize the advantages of allowing institutions to design informed consents,\nconsistent with §__.116(a)(5)(i), that are tailored to particular research studies to\nassist prospective subjects in understanding the most fundamental aspects of the\ninformed consent. For this reason, the final rule does not strictly specify the types\nof information that should or should not be included to satisfy §__.116(a)(5)(i), or\nthe length of such concise and focused presentations. This flexibility is responsive\nto public comments recommending against a rigid approach to enable institutions\nand individuals to tailor informed consents to the circumstances of particular\nstudies. A discussion of the key information to be included in the beginning\nsection of the consent form, and how it will operate in practice, may be further\nclarified in future guidance.\nWe also recognize that for some relatively simple research studies with limited\nrisks or benefits, the entire informed consent document may be relatively brief\nand still satisfy §__.116. In such circumstances, an institution may determine that\nvirtually all of the information required by §__.116 would also satisfy §__.116(a)(5)\n(i). In such cases, the informed consent document could include the concise and\nfocused presentation of §__.116(a)(5)(i) at the beginning of the informed consent\ndocument, followed by limited additional information required to satisfy §__.116.\nIn all circumstances (those involving lengthy and complex informed consents as\nwell as short and relatively simple informed consents), if information included at\nthe beginning of the informed consent satisfies both §__.116(a)(5)(i) and the\nelements of informed consent under §__.116(b) and §__.116(c) more generally,\nthe information included at the beginning need not be repeated later in the body\nof the informed consent. Thus, with respect to the example provided above\nconcerning a clinical trial with cancer patients, the most important reasonably\nforeseeable risks to subjects would be summarized at the beginning of the\ninformed consent as part of §__.116(a)(5)(i)’s concise and focused presentation,\nbut that a more comprehensive and detailed description of reasonably\nforeseeable risks to subjects would be included later in the body of the informed\nconsent. In contrast, with respect to a relatively simple research study with limited10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 91/121risks, we would expect that all of the information provided to potential subjects\nconcerning such risks might satisfy both §__.116(a)(5)(i) (as part of a concise and\nfocused presentation of key information) and §__.116(b)(2) (a description of any\nreasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject). In such circumstances,\nthe information provided at the beginning of the informed consent would not\nneed to be repeated or further detailed in the informed consent and the entire\ninformed consent could be relatively short.\n \nIn general, we would expect that to satisfy §__.116(a)(5)(i), the beginning of an\ninformed consent would include a concise explanation of the following: (1) the\nfact that consent is being sought for research and that participation is voluntary;\n(2) the purposes of the research, the expected duration of the prospective\nsubject’s participation, and the procedures to be followed in the research; (3) the\nreasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the prospective subject; (4) the\nbenefits to the prospective subject or to others that may reasonably be expected\nfrom the research; and (5) appropriate alternative procedures or courses of\ntreatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the prospective subject. As a\ngeneral matter, a brief description of these five factors would encompass the key\ninformation most likely to assist a reasonable person (or legally authorized\nrepresentative) in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to\nparticipate in research, as required by §__.116(a)(5)(i) and §__.116(a)(4). However,\nwe recognize that this determination is necessarily fact-specific and that IRBs and\ninstitutions may require that somewhat di\u0000erent (or additional) information be\npresented at the beginning of an informed consent to satisfy §__.116(a)(5)(i).\nThe NPRM also proposed adding a new requirement to the general introductory\nparagraph of §__.116, which would provide that if an authorization required by 45\nCFR parts 160 and 164 (parts of the HIPAA Privacy Rule) is combined with a\nconsent form, the authorization elements required by 45 CFR 164.508 must be\nincluded in the consent form (and not the appendices). Because this final rule\ndoes not incorporate the distinction proposed in the NPRM between the informed\nconsent and appendices, the final rule does not incorporate this language.\nWe are satisfied that the approach adopted in this final rule will enable regulated\nentities and individuals to pursue di\u0000erent and innovative approaches to\nobtaining informed consent, as recommended in some public comments, while\nensuring that the important aspects of informed consent are clearly\ncommunicated to prospective subjects and subjects.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 92/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

First, because the final rule at §__.102(e)(1) now states that the\ndefinition of human subject, in part, includes research in which an investigator\nobtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable biospecimens or\nidentifiable private information, this new element of informed consent has been\nclarified to specifically apply to any research that involves the collection of\nidentifiable biospecimens, rather than all biospecimens, in addition to research\nthat involves the collection of identifiable private information. In addition, a\nchange to what was proposed in the NPRM has been made to the new element of\nconsent in the final rule at §__.116(b)(9)(ii), to clarify that it is intended to inform\nsubjects that their information or biospecimens collected as part of the research\nwill not be used or distributed for future research, even if identifiers are removed.\nWe agree with the public comments that indicated this new element of consent\nwill provide useful information to prospective subjects about whether their\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens might be stripped of\nidentifiers and used for future research studies or distributed to another\ninvestigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from\nthe subject or the legally authorized representative.\nWe expect that this information can usually be provided in a brief statement, and\ndisagree with the commenters that suggested that this new basic element of\nconsent would increase the length of consent forms without appreciably\nimproving potential subjects’ understanding of a specific research activity. This\nnew requirement is intended to give the potential subject a right to know that10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 93/121identifiers might be removed from information or biospecimens and be used for\nfuture research without additional consent, when such a possibility exists, so he\nor she can make a fully informed decision about whether to participate in the\nresearch. If subjects’ identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens\nwill not be used for future research studies, even if identifiers are removed, this\nnew element of consent requires that subjects be informed of this as well. Finally,\nif a specific technology or technique determined to be capable of generating\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens through the\nconsultative process described at §__.102(e)(7) will be used, that information\nshould be included in the description of the research at §__.116(b)(1).\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

Because many public\ncomments addressed a desire to share in the profits of successful products\ndeveloped using their biospecimens, we believe that investigators, when10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 94/121appropriate, should inform prospective subjects about whether they might or\nmight not benefit commercially from future products resulting from the research,\nshould that possibility be important in their decision making process. Also, several\ncomments received from individuals who reported participation in research\nstudies described disappointment that research results were not returned to\nthem. We believe that potential subjects should be aware of the possibility that\nthey might not receive research results, as well as the possibility that they might,\nso that they can factor that information into their decision about whether to\nconsent to research. This provision is intended to pertain to all clinically relevant\nresearch results, including general or aggregate research findings and individual\nresearch results.\nWe are also including in the final rule an additional element that when\nappropriate for research involving biospecimens, subjects be informed of whether\nthe research will (if known) or might include whole genome sequencing (WGS)\n(§__.116(c)(9)). This provision of the final rule describes WGS as the sequencing of\na human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or\nexome sequence of that specimen. WGS generates an extremely large amount of\ninformation about people, including factors that will contribute to their future\nmedical conditions. As was recognized in the NPRM’s Alternative Proposal A to\nexpand the definition of “human subject” to include WGS (discussed in Section III\n[of the final rule preamble]), data obtained through WGS can provide important\ninsights into the health of individuals as well as their biological family. It is also\npossible that WGS data gathered for one purpose may reveal important\ninformation, perhaps unanticipated and unplanned for, years later. Given the\nunique implications of the information that can be developed through WGS, if it is\neither known that a specific research study will include this technique, or might\ninclude it, we believe that this aspect of the research must be disclosed to\nprospective subjects as part of the informed consent process. It is recognized that\nunder the pre-2018 rule, if a research study were to involve WGS, this research\nprocedure would have almost always been included in the description of the\nresearch. However, to remove any ambiguity about whether such information\nwould need to be included in the informed consent, the final rule makes this\nrequirement explicit through this new element of consent.\nThe information that would have to be disclosed under these additional elements\nof consent is o\u0000en relevant to an individual’s decision of whether to participate in\na research study.

However, the final rule now requires inclusion of\nthese additional elements, when appropriate.\nThe additional element of consent proposed in the NPRM that was not included in\nthe final rule would have required providing subjects or their legally authorized\nrepresentatives with an option to consent, or refuse to consent, to investigators\nre-contacting the subject to seek additional information or biospecimens or to\ndiscuss participation in another research study. Although for some research\nstudies, it will be desirable to inform prospective subjects about investigators’\nplan to re-contact subjects for certain purposes, and give them the option to agree\nor disagree to such re-contact, we agree with the public comments that\nquestioned the importance of requiring that such information be included in the\nconsent form. Although the final rule does not include this additional element of\nconsent, this information can be included in the consent form.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

Although in some\nways the final rule’s broad consent provision resembles the provision that was\nproposed in the NPRM, it is important to recognize a very fundamental di\u0000erence10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 96/121between the role that this provision will play under the final rule, as compared to\nthe role it was intended to play under the NPRM. This key di\u0000erence relates to the\nfact that the provisions in the NPRM that would have generally required consent\nfor secondary research use of nonidentified biospecimens, including imposing\nnarrow stringent criteria for IRB waiver of consent with respect to such research,\nare not being implemented because the NPRM’s proposal that all biospecimens,\nregardless of their identifiability, be covered under the Common Rule has not\nbeen adopted. Importantly, under the final rule, broad consent is permissible only\nfor secondary research and no other types of research.\nThus, had all of those NPRM provisions been implemented, investigators who\nwanted to conduct secondary research with biospecimens would in most\ninstances have found themselves essentially forced to use the new broad consent\nprovisions as their only practical option for conducting such research. This is\nbecause generally, under the NPRM proposals, they would no longer have had the\noption to de-identify information or biospecimens, or to use them in coded form,\nto avoid application of the Common Rule’s requirements. Under the NPRM’s\nproposals, had investigators not obtained broad consent, they would o\u0000en not\npracticably be able to meet the informed consent requirements relating to such\nresearch (which would have been covered under the Common Rule). Therefore, it\nwould generally have been the case that they would have had little choice but to\nobtain broad consent, assuming they did not want to undertake the alternative of\nobtaining study-specific consent from subjects each and every time they\nconducted a study involving secondary use of biospecimens.\nGiven that we did not adopt the NPRM’s proposal to cover all biospecimens\nregardless of their identifiability under the Common Rule, the final rule also does\nnot adopt proposed consent requirements for secondary research with\nnonidentified biospecimens. For this reason, the final rule’s provisions relating to\nbroad consent now play a very di\u0000erent role from those proposed in the NPRM. In\nmost instances, these provisions will be providing new options - that is, new\nflexibility - to an investigator, in addition to those options that an investigator\nwould have had under the pre-2018 rule. An investigator wishing to do secondary\nresearch with biospecimens will continue to have the option of doing secondary\nresearch with nonidentifiable biospecimens, as was the case in the pre-2018 rule.\nAn investigator also could continue to use biospecimens that are coded, thus\nallowing the collection of additional information about the subjects over time. In\nboth of those instances, no additional consent would be required because the10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 97/121research would not involve human subjects as defined by the final rule.\nFurthermore, even if the investigator wanted to use the biospecimens with\nidentifiers attached, he or she would still have the option of asking an IRB to waive\nthe requirement to obtain informed consent: the waiver criteria are in most\nrespects unchanged under the final rule.\nFor these reasons, the broad consent provisions at §__.116(d) a\u0000ord investigators\nwishing to conduct secondary research on identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens an additional alternative to obtaining an IRB waiver of\nconsent or to obtaining study-specific consent. Given that these new broad\nconsent provisions are essentially a new alternative to other options that are very\nsimilar to those that existed under the pre-2018 rule, these provisions are not\nincreasing any regulatory burden or making it more di\u0000icult to do research.\nIndeed, just the opposite is the case. The changes made in the final rule are\nresponsive to the significant criticisms expressed by many of the commenters\nabout what the NPRM proposed, under which obtaining broad consent would\nhave imposed substantial new burdens on a vast amount of secondary research\nwith biospecimens. In contrast, when investigators choose to use the broad\nconsent provisions under the final rule, they will presumably be doing so because\nthis new option is less burdensome to them than their other (largely unchanged)\noptions for conducting such research.\nAlthough we recognize public commenters’ concern that broad consent might not\nbe as meaningful or informative as study-specific consent, it is also important to\nnote that when an investigator chooses to use this new option, doing so will\ngenerally provide increased protection to the autonomy of research subjects. It\nwill give them a choice to say no to such research, in contrast to most of the other\nroutes by which an investigator might generally choose to conduct this type of\nresearch, such as with a waiver of informed consent, which allows research to take\nplace regardless of the wishes of the person whose information or biospecimens\nare being studied, and without their knowledge. In addition, in response to the\npublic’s concerns that broad consent would not be meaningful, some of the\nelements of broad consent have changed from what was proposed in the NPRM to\nrequire more specific information about the research that may be conducted. As\ndiscussed in the NPRM, one of the main purposes of the final rule is to facilitate\nthe conduct of minimal risk research, while enhancing subjects’ autonomy. We\nbelieve that the option to obtain broad consent furthers this goal.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 98/121It is important to recognize that broad consent is a permissible option only for\nsecondary research. Secondary research is limited to research using identifiable\nprivate information or identifiable biospecimens that are collected for either\nresearch studies other than the proposed research or nonresearch purposes. It is\nnot permissible to obtain broad consent for any other type of research (e.g.,\nresearch involving the collection of information or biospecimens through a\nresearch interaction or intervention with a subject). The informed consent\nrequirements in §__.116(b) and (c) will be applicable to all human subjects\nresearch for which broad consent is not an option. However, it is envisioned that\nresearch requiring study-specific consent, such as research involving the\ncollection of information or biospecimens through a research interaction or\nintervention with a subject, will sometimes also involve seeking subjects’ broad\nconsent for the secondary research use of identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens obtained as part of the original research study.\nWhen broad consent is obtained, the general requirements for informed consent\nin §__.116(a) apply, except that the requirements at §__.116(a)(5) (imposing\ncertain requirements concerning the presentation of information for informed\nconsent and prescribing the order in which consent information is presented) do\nnot apply to broad consent.\nWe expect that, given the di\u0000erent requirements set forth for study-specific\nconsent and broad consent, some institutions and investigators may elect to\npursue study-specific consents for the storage, maintenance, and secondary\nresearch uses of identifiable private information and identifiable biospecimens (or\nfor some subset of such research) whereas other institutions and investigators\nmay elect to pursue broad consent for the same types of research (or for some\nsubset of such research). For instance, with regard to the public comments raising\nconcern about broad consent being sought from AI/AN peoples, it is expected that\ninstitutions, investigators, and IRBs will consider these concerns when\ndetermining when it might be appropriate to seek study-specific consent for the\nsecondary research use of identifiable biospecimens, as well as the need for tribal\nconsent, when appropriate.\nPerhaps even more commonly, however, given that the NPRM proposal regarding\ngenerally requiring consent for research use of nonidentifiable biospecimens has\nnot been adopted, many investigators may choose to use the routes that\npreviously existed under the pre-2018 rule, and will continue to exist, for\nconducting such research without informed consent under the Common Rule.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 99/121Those options include using nonidentifiable biospecimens, including perhaps\nhaving a code maintained that will allow the investigator to obtain additional\ninformation about the subjects, or obtaining a waiver from an IRB of the need to\nobtain informed consent.\nThe broad consent provision in the final rule is di\u0000erent in three main ways from\nwhat was proposed in the NPRM. First, consistent with the decision not to revise\nthe definition of human subject to include biospecimens regardless of\nidentifiability, the broad consent provision in §__.116(d) only applies to secondary\nresearch using identifiable private information and identifiable biospecimens.\nSecond, the elements of broad consent have been strengthened and simplified in\nresponse to public comments. The final rule strengthens the element of broad\nconsent proposed in the NPRM regarding the need to provide a general\ndescription of the types of research that may be conducted with identifiable\nprivate information and identifiable biospecimens. It does this by requiring that\nthis description must include su\u0000icient information to allow a reasonable person\nto expect that the broad consent would permit the types of research conducted.\nThis “reasonable person” standard is consistent with the interpretation that the\nO\u0000ice for Civil Rights provided for authorization obtained from an individual for\nthe use or disclosure of protected health information for future research purposes.\nIn addition, the final rule has been strengthened to require that when subjects will\nnot be informed about the details for any specific research studies that might be\nconducted using their identifiable private information or identifiable\nbiospecimens, the broad consent must disclose this fact and inform subjects that\nthey might have chosen not to consent to some of those specific research studies.\nIt is envisioned that for certain types of research, such as research for which there\nis reason to believe some subjects will find the research controversial or\nobjectionable, a more robust description of the research will be required in order\nto meet this “reasonable person” standard. This requirement has been included in\nthe final rule in recognition of the concerns raised by some public commenters\nthat broad consent would not be meaningful because it will not provide detailed\ninformation about specific research studies that might be conducted with the\nindividual’s identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.\nAs proposed in the NPRM, the final rule permits broad consent to be sought for\neither a narrow type of research to be conducted in the future (e.g., cancer\nresearch), or a broader scope of10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 100/121research. Given this flexibility, while the final rule includes an exemption for\nsecondary research for which broad consent is required, the exemption is\ncontingent on several criteria being satisfied, including that an IRB determines\nthat the research to be conducted is within the scope of the broad consent\n(§__.104(d)(8)). This exemption is further discussed in Section V [of the final rule\npreamble]. For research that is not exempt, the IRB is expected to assess whether\nthe description of the research included in the broad consent form is adequate to\npermit a reasonable person to expect that they were providing consent for the\ncurrently proposed secondary research study.\nWhile strengthening the broad consent requirements, the final rule also adopts\nsimplified and more flexible elements of broad consent than what was proposed\nin the NPRM. For example, the final rule requires that the broad consent include a\ndescription of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens\nthat might be used in research, whether sharing of such information or\nbiospecimens might occur, and the types of institutions or investigators that\nmight conduct research with such information or biospecimens. However, the\nfinal rule does not adopt the NPRM’s proposed limitations on the research use of\nbiospecimens or identifiable private information obtained for nonresearch\npurposes, that would have only permitted a broad consent to cover either or both\nof the following: (1) biospecimens or identifiable private information that exist at\nthe time at which broad consent is sought; and (2) biospecimens or identifiable\nprivate information that will be collected up to 10 years a\u0000er broad consent is\nobtained or until the child reaches the legal age of consent to the treatments or\nprocedures involved in the research, whichever comes first. We were persuaded\nby the public comments that raised concerns about the complexity and tracking\nburden that such limitations would impose, without clearly o\u0000ering individuals a\nmore meaningful way to control the use of their information or biospecimens.\nIn addition, the broad consent requirements have been simplified to avoid\ncreating redundant requirements with the basic elements of informed consent\nunder §__.116(b) that must also be included in broad consent obtained under\n§__.116(d). For example, in the final rule, it is required that broad consent include\na statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no\npenalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and the\nsubject may discontinue participation at any time without loss of benefits to10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 101/121which the subject is otherwise entitled ((§__.116(d)(1), incorporating §__.116(b)(8)\nfor broad consent). Therefore, the comparable element of broad consent that was\nproposed in the NPRM is not included in the final rule.\nAs discussed in the NPRM, we expect that, when appropriate, this element of\nbroad consent will inform subjects that information that has been stripped of\nidentifiers might not be traceable, and thus it might not be feasible to withdraw\nconsent for future use or distribution in this case. However, if an investigator\ncommits to permitting a subject to discontinue use of the subject’s identifiable\nprivate information or identifiable biospecimens, it is expected that the\ninvestigator will honor this commitment by not removing identifiers.\nSimilarly, the final rule also does not include the element of broad consent\nproposed in the NPRM that, when relevant, would have required the broad\nconsent to include an option for an adult subject or the representative to consent,\nor refuse to consent, to the inclusion of the subject’s data, with removal of the\nidentifiers listed in 45 CFR 164.514(b)(2)(i)(A) through (Q), in a database that is\npublicly and openly accessible to anyone, and that this option be prominently\nnoted and include a description of the risks of public access to the data. We\nbelieve this proposed requirement is unnecessary because it overlaps with the\nbroad consent elements included in the final rule requiring a statement describing\nthe extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be\nmaintained (§__.116(d)(1), incorporating §__.116(b)(5) for broad consent), and a\ndescription of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject\n(§__.116(d)(1), incorporating §__.116(b)(2) for broad consent).\nThe final rule includes a slightly di\u0000erent provision relating to the return of\nresearch results than that proposed in the NPRM. As set forth in §__.116(d)(6) of\nthe final rule, unless it is known that clinically relevant research results, including\nindividual research results, will be disclosed to the subject in all circumstances, a\nstatement that such results may not be disclosed to the subject must be included\nin the broad consent. This element of broad consent di\u0000ers from the related\nrequirement in §__.116(c)(8) that pertains when an investigator is seeking consent\nfor a specific study, since unlike the circumstances under which broad consent is\nlikely to be sought, investigators seeking consent for a specific study will know if\nthe study includes a plan to return research results to subjects. The NPRM\nproposed that a general element of informed consent be included as part of a\nbroad consent, namely that the consent include a statement regarding whether\nclinically relevant research results, including individual research results, would be10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 102/121disclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions. The language adopted in\nthe final rule is intended to provide transparency, but is tailored to the broad\nconsent context as those seeking broad consent may not know whether clinically\nrelevant research results, including individual research results, will always be\ndisclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions. Nonetheless, unless\ninvestigators know that such results will be disclosed to subjects in all\ncircumstances, subjects will be informed through a broad consent of the\npossibility that such results will not be disclosed to them. This provision is\nintended to pertain to all clinically relevant research results, including general or\naggregate research findings and individual research results. This element of broad\nconsent will a\u0000ect the applicability of the exemption set forth at §__.104(d)(8), for\nsecondary research for which broad consent is required. This exemption applies\nonly if the investigator does not include returning individual research results to\nsubjects as part of the study plan (noting, however, that this provision does not\nprevent an investigator from abiding by any legal requirements to return\nindividual research results). Although it is envisioned that broad consent will o\u0000en\nbe sought with the expectation that specific secondary research studies using\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens will be exempt under\n§__.104(d)(8), this will not always be the case. Broad consent can also be obtained\nfor secondary research that will not qualify for this exemption, such as secondary\nresearch that will involve returning clinically relevant research results to subjects.\nIn these cases, the specific secondary research study will need to undergo IRB\nreview and approval under §__.111, and we expect that the IRB would consider\nwhat subjects were told in the broad consent regarding the return of research\nresults. The only exception to the requirement for IRB review of such research, if\ncovered by this policy, is if the research qualifies for another exemption or the\nresearch is carried out under a Secretarial waiver at §__.101(i).\nFinally, the third main di\u0000erence between the NPRM and final rule provision on\nbroad consent is that the final rule does not include broad consent templates to\nbe established by the Secretary of HHS. We agree with the public comments that\nfavored allowing institutions to create their own broad consent forms that could\nbe tailored to a variety of circumstances. Therefore, under the final rule,\ninvestigators and institutions may develop broad consent forms, which, provided\nspecified conditions are satisfied, would meet the exemption for the storage and\nmaintenance for secondary research use of identifiable biospecimens or\nidentifiable private information (§__.104(d)(7)). This exemption is further10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 103/121discussed in Section V [of the final rule preamble]. At a later time, the Secretary of\nHHS expects to develop guidance on broad consent, which could include broad\nconsent templates.\nIn addition, we are also including in the final rule an element that for research\ninvolving biospecimens, when appropriate, the broad consent must state whether\nthe research will (if known) or might include whole genome sequencing (WGS)\n(§__.116(d)(1), incorporating §__.116(c)(9)). The reasons for requiring this element\nin the broad consent are similar to those discussed above regarding the addition\nof this requirement in the additional elements of consent at §__.116(c)(9). WGS\ngenerates an extremely large amount of data, which when analyzed can yield\ninformation about an individual, including factors that could contribute to their\nfuture medical conditions. Therefore, given the implications of WGS information\nfor an individual and his or her biological family, if it is known that the broad\nconsent will or might permit the use of individuals’ biospecimens for WGS, we\nbelieve that this aspect of the research must be disclosed to prospective subjects\nas part of the broad consent process. The broad consent must include a general\ndescription of the types of research that may be conducted with the identifiable\nprivate information or identifiable biospecimens, with su\u0000icient information to\nallow a reasonable person to expect that the broad consent would permit the\ntypes of research conducted (§__.116(d)(2)). Including an additional element of\nbroad consent that specifically addresses WGS makes it clear that such\ninformation must be disclosed to prospective subjects.\nUnder the final rule, if the subject or the subject’s legally authorized\nrepresentative is asked to provide broad consent, the broad consent must satisfy\nthe general informed consent requirements at §__.116(a)(1)-(4), and (a)(6), and\nmust include all of the following 12 elements that are applicable:\nA description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the\nsubjects (§__.116(d)(1), incorporating basic elements of informed consent in\n§__.116(b)(2));\nA description of any benefits to the subject or to others that may reasonably\nbe expected from the research ((§__.116(d)(1), incorporating basic elements of\ninformed consent in §__.116(b)(3);\nA statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records\nidentifying the subject will be maintained ((§__.116(d)(1), incorporating basic\nelements of informed consent in §__.116(b)(5));10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 104/121A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve\nno penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and\nthe subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss\nof benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled ((§__.116(d)(1),\nincorporating basic elements of informed consent in §__.116(b)(8));\nIf applicable, a statement that the subject’s biospecimens (even if identifiers\nare removed) may be used for commercial profit and whether the subject will\nor will not share in this commercial profit ((§__.116(d)(1), incorporating\nadditional elements of consent in §__.116(c)(7));\nWhen appropriate, for research involving biospecimens, whether the research\nwill (if known) or might include WGS (i.e., sequencing of a human germline or\nsomatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or exome sequence\nof that specimen.)

The final rule adopts (in §__.116(e)(1)) the language proposed in the\nNPRM providing that if an individual was asked to consent to the storage or\nmaintenance for secondary research use of identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens in accordance with the proposed broad consent\nprovisions and such individual refused to consent, the IRB would be prohibited\nfrom waiving consent for the storage, maintenance, or the secondary research use\nof such biospecimens or information. The references in this provision to\nbiospecimens are changed to refer specifically to identifiable biospecimens as the\nfinal rule does not apply to the research use of nonidentifiable biospecimens. This10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 106/121change is intended to honor the autonomy of individuals and to further the\nBelmont Report principle of respect for persons, in that this provision will prevent\nan individual’s refusal to consent to additional research use of information or\nbiospecimens from being overridden.\nThe final rule does not incorporate the NPRM’s proposed additional waiver\ncriterion to apply to research involving the use of biospecimens. This change is\nnot necessary given that the proposal in the NPRM that the Common Rule extend\nto all biospecimens has not been adopted in the final rule. We determined that the\nwaiver and alteration criteria included in the final rule are appropriately protective\nof identifiable biospecimens, as defined at §__.102(e)(6) and that an additional\nwaiver criterion for such biospecimens is not warranted. For example, §__.116(e)\n(3)(ii) mandates that an IRB may not waive or alter the requirements of informed\nconsent with respect to research under this category unless the research could not\npracticably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.\nThe format and organization of §__.116(e) in the final rule is di\u0000erent from that\nincluded in the pre-2018 rule or proposed in the NPRM. These changes were\nimplemented to be clearer about the e\u0000ect of each requirement. Most\nsignificantly, §__.116(e) in the final rule provides separate paragraphs concerning\nthe applicable criteria for waiver and the applicable criteria for alteration of the\nrequirements for informed consent. This di\u0000ers from the approach proposed in\nthe NPRM, and the approach included in the pre-2018 rule, that did not separate\nthose discussions. We concluded that separating the discussion of waiver and the\ndiscussion of alteration would help clarify the applicable criteria, particularly\ngiven that the final rule addresses broad consent.\nSection __.116(e)(1) describes the general framework for an IRB to waive the\nrequirements for informed consent. This paragraph explains that an IRB may\nwaive the requirement to obtain informed consent under §__.116(a) (general\nrequirements for informed consent), §__.116(b) (basic elements of informed\nconsent), or §__.116(c) (additional elements of informed consent that apply to\ncertain research) if the IRB satisfies the criteria set forth at §__.116(e)(3)\n(discussed below). As explained above, the ability to satisfy the requirement to\nobtain informed consent of a subject or a subject’s legally authorized\nrepresentative through use of a broad consent in particular circumstances is a\nflexibility o\u0000ered to institutions, but institutions are never required to obtain\ninformed consent through a broad consent process. For this reason, §__.116(e)(1)\ndoes not provide that an IRB may waive the requirement to obtain informed10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 107/121consent under §__.116(d) (broad consent) because use of broad consent is not a\nrequirement. As noted above, and to honor the autonomy of individuals,\n§__.116(e)(1) prohibits an IRB from waiving consent for the storage, maintenance,\nor secondary research uses of identifiable private biospecimens or identifiable\nprivate information if an individual was asked to provide broad consent for such\npurposes and refused to provide such consent.\nSection __.116(e)(2) describes the general framework for an IRB to alter the\nrequirements for informed consent. An IRB may omit or alter some or all of the\nelements of informed consent under §__.116(b) (basic elements of informed\nconsent) or §__.116(c) (additional elements of informed consent that apply to\ncertain research) if the IRB satisfies the criteria set forth at §__.116(e)(3)\n(discussed below). This is consistent with the proposal made in the NPRM. This\nparagraph further explains that an IRB may not omit or alter any of the\nrequirements described in §__.116(a) (general requirements for informed\nconsent). This is also consistent with the proposal made in the NPRM (which\nproposed permitting an IRB to omit or alter elements of informed consent, but did\nnot propose permitting omissions or alterations of the general requirements of\ninformed consent that were included in the unnumbered introductory paragraph\nin the pre-2018 rule at §__.116). This paragraph also specifies that if a broad\nconsent is used, an IRB may not omit or alter any of the elements required under\n§__.116(d). We determined that it would not be appropriate to permit the\nomission or alteration of any of the broad consent elements given the fact that the\nrequired elements of broad consent are limited and given our view that each of\nthese elements (described at §__.116(d)) is critical for the purpose of soliciting\nbroad consent that is both informed and ethically appropriate. This approach is\ndi\u0000erent from what was proposed in the NPRM because of the NPRM’s di\u0000erent\napproach to broad consent than that adopted in the final rule.\nSection __.116(e)(3) sets forth the specific criteria that an IRB must find and\ndocument to waive or alter the requirements for informed consent, consistent\nwith the limitations set forth in §__.116(e)(1) and §__.116(e)(2). These criteria are\nthe same as those proposed in the NPRM. First, the IRB must find and document\nthat the research or demonstration project is to be conducted by or subject to the\napproval of state or local government o\u0000icials and is designed to study, evaluate,\nor otherwise examine public benefit or service programs; procedures for obtaining\nbenefits or services under those programs; possible changes in or alternatives to\nthose programs or procedures; or possible changes in methods or levels of10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 108/121payment for benefits or services under those programs.

The final rule adopts (in §__.116(f)(3)(iii)) a new waiver\ncriterion very similar to that proposed in the NPRM, which now mandates that for\nresearch involving access to or use of identifiable private information or\nidentifiable biospecimens, the requirements of informed consent can be waived\nor altered only if the research could not practicably be carried out without using\nsuch information or biospecimens in an identifiable format. The minor wording\nchange made in the language of this provision, as compared with that proposed in\nthe NPRM, is intended for clarity. This change is intended to protect the privacy of\nindividuals, while not unduly inhibiting research. A\u0000er considering the diversity of\nopinions expressed in the public comments on this issue, including many\ncomments seeking further guidance concerning the proper interpretation of the\n“practicably” language, the final rule does not define this language (which was\nalso included in the pre-2018 rule). We have concluded that the requirements for\nwaiver and alteration in §__.116(e) and (f) appropriately honor respect for persons\nand balances this with other ethical principles.\nThe final rule also adopts (in §__.116(f)(1)) the language proposed in the NPRM\n(for §__.116(f)(3)) prohibiting IRBs from waiving informed consent if individuals\nwere asked and declined to provide broad consent to the storage and\nmaintenance for secondary research use of identifiable private information or10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 109/121identifiable biospecimens (except that the final rule’s formulation is limited to\nidentifiable biospecimens, consistent with changes made in the final rule). We\nconsidered public comments that opposed this prohibition and understand that\nIRBs may not always understand the reason that individuals refused to sign a\nconsent form and that the e\u0000ects of this broad prohibition could be significant in\nthe context of broad consent (given the broad scope of research that such a broad\nconsent could potentially extend to). Nonetheless, we determined that it is\nimportant to prevent an individual’s refusal to consent to additional research use\nof such information or biospecimens from being overridden. This change to the\nCommon Rule is intended to honor the autonomy of individuals and to further the\nBelmont Report principle of respect for persons.\nThe final rule does not incorporate the NPRM’s proposed additional waiver criteria\n(proposed for §__.116(f)(2)) to apply to research involving the use of\nbiospecimens. This change is not necessary given that the proposal in the NPRM\nthat the Common Rule extend to all biospecimens regardless of their\nidentifiability has not been adopted in the final rule. We determined that the\nwaiver and alteration criteria included in the final rule are appropriately protective\nof identifiable biospecimens and that an additional waiver criterion for such\nbiospecimens is not warranted. For example, §__.116(f)(3)(iii) in the final rule is a\nresearch criterion specific to research that involves using identifiable private\ninformation or identifiable biospecimens. Under this criterion, an IRB may not\nwaive or alter requirements of informed consent with respect to such research\nunless the IRB finds and documents that the research could not practicably be\ncarried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable\nformat.\nThe format and organization of §__.116(f) in the final rule are di\u0000erent from the\nproposed §__.116(f) described in the NPRM. We made these changes in an e\u0000ort\nto be clear about the e\u0000ect of each requirement. Most significantly, §__.116(f) in\nthe final rule provides separate paragraphs concerning the applicable criteria for\nwaiver and the applicable criteria for alteration of the requirements for informed\nconsent. This di\u0000ers from the approach proposed in the NPRM, and the approach\nincluded in the pre-2018 rule that did not separate those discussions. We conclude\nthat separating the discussion of waiver and alteration will help clarify the\napplicable criteria, particularly given that the final rule addresses the application\nof the waiver and alteration provisions in the context of broad consent.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 110/121Section __.116(f)(1) describes the general framework for an IRB to waive the\nrequirements for informed consent. This paragraph explains that an IRB may\nwaive the requirement to obtain informed consent under §__.116(a) (general\nrequirements for informed consent), §__.116(b) (basic elements of informed\nconsent), or §__.116(c) (additional elements of informed consent that apply to\ncertain research) if the research satisfies the criteria set forth at §__.116(f)(3)\n(discussed below). As explained above, the ability to satisfy the requirement to\nobtain informed consent of a subject or a subject’s legally authorized\nrepresentative through use of a broad consent in particular circumstances is a\nflexibility o\u0000ered to institutions, but institutions are never required to obtain\ninformed consent through a broad consent process. For this reason, §__.116(f)(1)\ndoes not provide that an IRB may waive the requirement to obtain informed\nconsent under §__.116(d) (broad consent) because use of broad consent is a\nregulatory flexibility, and not a requirement. Consistent with the proposal made in\nthe NPRM (proposed §__.116(f)(3)), § __.116(f)(1) provides that if an individual\nwas asked to provide broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary\nresearch use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens and\nrefused to consent, an IRB cannot waive consent for either the storage,\nmaintenance, or secondary research use of such biospecimens or information.\nSection__.116(f)(2) describes the general framework for an IRB to alter the\nrequirements for informed consent. This paragraph explains that an IRB may omit\nor alter some or all of the elements of informed consent under §__.116(b) (basic\nelements of informed consent) or §__.116(c) (additional elements of informed\nconsent that apply to certain research) if the IRB satisfies the criteria set forth at\n§__.116(f)(3) (discussed below). This is consistent with the proposal made in the\nNPRM. This paragraph further explains that an IRB may not omit or alter any of the\nrequirements described in §__.116(a) (general requirements for informed\nconsent). This is also consistent with the proposal made in the NPRM (which\nproposed permitting an IRB to omit or alter elements of informed consent, but did\nnot propose permitting omissions or alterations of the general requirements of\ninformed consent that were included in the unnumbered introductory paragraph\nin the pre-2018 rule at §__.116). This paragraph also specifies that when reviewing\na broad consent, an IRB may not omit or alter any of the elements required under\n§__.116(d). As with §__.116(e)(2), we determined that it would not be appropriate\nto permit the omission or alteration of any of the broad consent elements in\n§__.116(f). The elements of broad consent reflected in this NPRM are limited. We\nhave concluded that each of these elements (which are included at §__.116(d)) is10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 111/121critical to the solicitation of an informed and ethically appropriate broad consent.\nFor that reason, none of the elements of broad consent may be omitted or altered\nif broad consent is solicited. This prohibition is di\u0000erent than the NPRM’s proposal\ngiven the di\u0000erent formulation of broad consent represented in this final rule.\nSection 116(f)(3) sets forth the specific criteria that an IRB must find and\ndocument in order to waive or alter the requirements for informed consent. These\ncriteria are the same as those proposed in the NPRM, except that the third\ncriterion includes minor wording changes that were made for clarity: (1) the\nresearch involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; (2) the research could\nnot practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration; (3) if the\nresearch involves using identifiable private information or identifiable\nbiospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using\nsuch information or biospecimens in an identifiable format; (4) the waiver or\nalteration will not adversely a\u0000ect the rights and welfare of the subjects; and (5)\nwhenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent\ninformation a\u0000er participation.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

This change\nis intended to address these concerns by eliminating the requirement for the IRB\nto waive informed consent for these activities. In response to public comments,\nwe are clarifying that this is not a waiver of the consent requirement but rather an\nexception to the requirement. This change is also responsive to SACHRP’s\nrecommendation regarding how the Common Rule should apply to activities that\nare conducted before subjects provide consent to participate in research, such as\nidentifying potential subjects, contacting subjects, and recruiting subjects.\nThe final rule includes some minor changes from the NPRM proposal, to clarify the\ncircumstances in which the IRB may approve the investigator’s proposal to obtain\ninformation directly from a prospective subject, or to obtain already collected\nidentifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens by accessing records\nor stored biospecimens, for purposes of screening, recruiting, or eligibility\nassessment, without the informed consent of the prospective subject or the\nsubject’s legally authorized representative. The final rule also adds a reference to\nthe subject’s legally authorized representative at §__.116(g)(1) to clarify that this\nexception to informed consent will also apply in circumstances in which the\nprospective subject has a legally authorized representative who will provide\ninformation about the prospective subject through oral or written communication\nwith the investigator.\nWe note that in approving this exception to informed consent for the purpose of\nscreening, recruiting, or determining the eligibility of prospective subjects, the IRB\nwill be reviewing and approving the entire research proposal. Therefore, all of the\nIRB approval criteria at §__.111 will need to be satisfied, including that when\nappropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and\nto maintain the confidentiality of data (§__.111(a)(7)). Thus, as part of its review\nand approval of the research, the IRB must determine that there are adequate\nprivacy and confidentiality safeguards for information obtained by investigators\nfor these preparatory-to-research activities.\nWe believe that these preparatory-to-research activities are critical means by\nwhich to identify subjects that do not involve additional risks, given their limited\nnature. If prospective subjects are identified through these “screening” activities,\nthen all other relevant requirements of this rule must be met if they are\nsubsequently recruited to participate in the research.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 113/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

The primary purpose of this provision is to improve the quality of\nconsent forms in federally funded research by assuring that–contrary to current\npractices, under which it is o\u0000en very di\u0000icult to ever obtain a copy of these\ndocuments–they eventually would become subject to public scrutiny and that\nthey will provide useful models for others. The consent form plays a key role in\nmaking sure that someone asked to enter a clinical trial receives the information\nthey need to be making an informed decision about whether to enroll in that trial.\nAccordingly, it also plays a key role in supporting and justifying the public’s trust in\nthe integrity of our clinical trial enterprise.\nWe are not persuaded by the arguments of those commenters who suggest that\npotential negative consequences of this proposal outweigh its benefits.\nFundamentally, this proposal is about increasing the transparency of one of the\nmost important aspects of our human subjects protection system. Increased\ntransparency is in general a good thing, and in this instance, as in many others, it\no\u0000ers multiple benefits–including increased trust–at very low cost. This provision\nis not a form of shaming, but rather an e\u0000ort to ask people to work together to\ncreate a system that will improve the quality of informed consent. Moreover, the\nnew standards for determining the acceptable content of a consent form–\nincluding §__.116(a)(5), which will require a concise presentation of key\ninformation at the beginning of the consent form–should counter any\nconsequences of attempts to pad consent forms with additional information as a\nresponse to the posting requirement.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 114/121We are not persuaded by the arguments of those commenters who suggest that\npotential negative consequences of this proposal outweigh its benefits.\nFundamentally, this proposal is about increasing the transparency of one of the\nmost important aspects of our human subjects protection system.

Having a repository of such forms freely\navailable for analysis and public discussion will create multiple opportunities for\nimproving these forms. In an era in which we have previously unheard of\ncapabilities for analyzing textual material and processing large amounts of data,\nthe fact that there will be a high volume of consent forms posted should be a\nminor impediment, if any, to the ability to learn from the content of this database.\nWith regard to those who suggested that it would indeed be desirable to make\nconsent forms more public, but that posting should be optional, we note that\nnothing in the pre-2018 rule prevents the people in charge of research from\nmaking their consent forms public, yet that is rarely done. In order to significantly\nincrease the transparency of this portion of our system for protecting subjects, we\nare finalizing this proposal.\nWith regard to the commenters who were concerned that posting consent forms\nwould create a rich environment for litigation, it is noteworthy that the existing\nevidence fails to suggest that there has been much of a problem with regard to\ninappropriate litigation over clinical trials. Whatever disincentives currently exist\nfor such litigation, it seems unlikely that the mere fact that consent forms would\nnow be more available will dramatically alter such disincentives.\nWith regard to the commenters who were concerned about the added regulatory\nburden, we note that this change, compared to the traditional costs of clinical\ntrials, will add a relatively small amount of additional burden, one that is well\njustified in comparison to the likely increase in transparency. This new provision10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 115/121has specifically been designed to minimize that burden. And the final rule has\nbeen modified in a number of respects from the NPRM proposal in response to\npublic comments. As discussed below in detail, the time by which a consent form\nmust be posted has been greatly extended. That change would also address the\nconcerns of some commenters that the posted consent forms might create\nconfusion among research subjects. Furthermore, provisions have been added\nthat allow for redaction, as necessary, of portions of consent forms.\nAs a means of increasing transparency and facilitating the development of more\ninformative consent forms, the final rule accordingly requires at §__.116(h)(1) that\nfor clinical trials conducted or supported by a Common Rule department or\nagency, a copy of an IRB-approved version of a consent form that was used to\nenroll subjects would need to be posted by the awardee or the federal department\nor agency conducting the trial on a publicly available federal website that will be\nestablished as a repository for such forms. Unlike the NPRM, which required that\nthe “final version” of the consent form be posted, the final rule adds flexibility in\nmerely requiring that it be an IRB-approved consent form that was used for\nenrollment purposes. There is accordingly no further restriction as to which\nversion of a consent form (which might have been subject to many modifications\nover the course of time) must be posted. The final rule also gives greater flexibility\nthan the NPRM proposal in terms of when that posting needs to be done. It can\ntake place any time a\u0000er the trial is closed to recruitment, so long as the posting is\nno later than 60 days a\u0000er the last study visit by any subject (as required by the\nprotocol). If the federal department or agency supporting or conducting the\nclinical trial determines that certain information should not be made publicly\navailable on a federal website (e.g., confidential commercial information), the\ndepartment or agency may permit appropriate redactions to the information\nposted. In rare instances, it could be the case that the federal department or\nagency would determine that the very existence of a particular clinical trial should\nnot be publicly disclosed, in which case no posting relating to such a trial would\nbe required.\nThe final rule di\u0000ers from the NPRM proposal in that it no longer specifies that\ncertain information needs to be posted in addition to the consent form. This\nchange eliminates the need for mandatory posting of information that might not\nbe justified by the purposes of this provision.\nOnly one posting would be required for each multi-institution study. There is10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 116/121accordingly no expectation that a version would need to be posted for each class\nof subjects in the study (for example, a posting both for adults and for minors), nor\nfor each study site.\nWe also note that this provision applies only to those clinical trials that are\nconducted or supported by a federal department or agency.\nA website will be developed by HHS, which could be used by other federal\ndepartments or agencies, or the other federal departments or agencies could\ncreate their own websites for the posting of these consent forms. Public posting of\nconsent forms is intended to increase transparency, enhance confidence in the\nresearch enterprise, increase accountability, and inform the development of\nfuture consent forms. It is anticipated that the website will be searchable. With\nregard to the comments suggesting that ClinicalTrials.gov might be an appropriate\nchoice as the website, we agree that such a choice has the possibility of\nminimizing administrative burdens. Using ClinicalTrials.gov has another\nadvantage, in addition to what some of the commenters said. Many clinical trials\nfunded by HHS have records in ClincialTrials.gov due to requirements that certain\nclinical trials register and submit results information to that database (section\n402(j) of the Public Health Service Act and 42 CFR Part 11, and other policies that\nincentivize trial registration and results submission, such as the NIH Policy on\nDissemination of NIH-Funded Clinical Trial Information). The fact that these trials\nalready have a record in the database will mean that the burden of submission of\nthe informed consent document will be substantially lower. Accordingly, we will\ntake these points into consideration as we determine what federal website will be\nused to implement this provision.\nDisclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

The goal in\n§§__.116 and __.117 of the final rule is to facilitate a prospective subject’s or\nlegally authorized representative’s understanding of the reasons why one might or\nmight not want to participate in the research, in part by requiring that only the key\ninformation essential to decision making receive priority by appearing at the\nbeginning of the consent document. In the final rule, these requirements also\napply when a short form written informed consent process is used, or the\nrequirement for written informed consent is waived.\nWe agree with the majority of public comments that favored adding a new\nprovision allowing a waiver of the requirement for a signed consent form if the\nsubjects are members of a distinct cultural group or community for whom signing\ndocuments is not the norm, provided that the research presents no more than\nminimal risk of harm to subjects and there is an appropriate alternative method\nfor documenting that informed consent was obtained. Therefore, this new\nprovision is added at §__.117(c)(1)(iii). The final rule includes a reference to the\nsubject’s legally authorized representative to clarify that this provision applies\nwhen a subject has a legally authorized representative who is a member of a\ndistinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm.\nThe final rule does not include the NPRM’s proposal at §__.117(c)(3) to prohibit a\nwaiver of documentation of broad consent for the storage, maintenance, or\nsecondary research use of biospecimens.\nSome of those who commented on the NPRM proposals related to oral broad\nconsent found it to be unnecessarily confusing. In response to these comments,\nthe final rule permits waiver of documentation of informed consent under\n§§__.117(c) when a broad consent procedure is used. No additional criteria or\nspecial restrictions apply. Additionally, the final rule removes all NPRM references\nto “oral consent” to reduce confusion.\nHowever, we expect that it will rarely be permissible to waive documentation of\nbroad consent for the secondary research use of medical records or stored\nbiospecimens because there will likely be a need to track which individuals have10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 118/121provided broad consent and which have not, so the informed consent would not\nbe the only record linking the subject and the research as required for a waiver\nunder §__.117(c)(1)(i). Additionally, when identifiable information and\nidentifiable biospecimens are shared for a nonresearch purposes, the person’s\nconsent is usually required, so we expect that documentation of consent o\u0000en\ncould not be waived under §§__.117(c)(1)(ii), which requires that the research\ninvolves only procedures for which written consent is not normally required\noutside of the research context.\nOne instance when we believe it may be appropriate for the IRB to waive the\nrequirement for a signed broad consent form is when the initial activity involved\nobtaining information from a person through oral communication, such as a\nphone survey, because there might not be an opportunity to obtain written broad\nconsent from such individuals for the secondary research use of their information.\nIn this scenario, documentation of broad consent could be waived under\n§__.117(c)(1)(ii) if the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to\nsubjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally\nrequired outside of the research context. In addition, it might be appropriate for\nan IRB to waive the requirement for a signed broad consent document under the\nprovision included in the final rule related to when the subjects or their legally\nauthorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community\nfor whom signing documents is not the norm, provided that the research presents\nno more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and an appropriate alternative\nmethod is available for documenting that informed consent was obtained\n(§__.117(c)(1)(iii)).\nThe final rule also does not include the NPRM’s proposed clarification that waivers\nof documentation may not be permitted for research subject to regulation by FDA.\nBecause this is not the only di\u0000erence between what is permitted under the\nCommon Rule and the FDA regulations, we determined that clarifying only this\nspecific di\u0000erence in the final rule is likely to create more confusion rather than\nprovide clarification.10/4/24, 7:25 PM Excerpts from the January 19, 2017 Revised Common Rule Preamble | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/2018-req-preamble/index.html 119/121Disclaim er: Preamble language operates as the agency’s contemporaneous\ninterpretation and explanation of the regulatory requirements, and is not part of the\nenforceable regulatory requirements themselves.

The full text of the determination appears\nbelow.\nAn o\u0000icial website of the United States government\nNavigate to:10/4/24, 7:14 PM November 21, 2019: Determination of Exception for Certain HHS | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/november-2019-exception-determination/index.html 1/7I. Background\nRegulatory History\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, HHS and other Federal departments\nand agencies revised the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the\n\"Common Rule\"), codified with respect to HHS at subpart A of 45 CFR part 46. The\nCommon Rule is followed by 19 other Federal departments and agencies, either as\nCommon Rule signatories, or as required by Executive Order or statute. The\nrevised Common Rule, including amendments made by a January 22, 2018\ninterim final rule (83 FR 2885) and June 19, 2018 final rule (83 FR 28497) (also\nreferred to as the \"2018 Requirements\"), became e\u0000ective on July 19, 2018.\nThe revised Common Rule requires that U.S. institutions engaged in cooperative\nresearch must rely on a single institutional review board (IRB) to review and\napprove the portion of the research conducted at domestic sites. See 45 CFR\n46.114(b). The compliance date for the single IRB requirement is January 20, 2020.\nThe revised Common Rule applies to all research initially approved by an IRB on\nor a\u0000er January 21, 2019. See 45 CFR 46.101(l)(5). As of January 20, 2020, the\ncompliance date for the single IRB requirement, all cooperative research subject\nto the revised Common Rule will be required to use a single IRB, whether the\nresearch was initially approved by a single IRB or multiple IRBs.\nRegulatory Allowance of Exceptions to\nSingle IRB Review Requirement\nThe revised Common Rule provides that the agency conducting or supporting\ncooperative research may except the research from the single IRB mandate. To do\nso, the agency must both determine and document that using a single IRB is not\nappropriate in the particular context. See 45 CFR 46.114(b)(2).10/4/24, 7:14 PM November 21, 2019: Determination of Exception for Certain HHS | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/november-2019-exception-determination/index.html 2/7Research Contexts Qualifying for Exception\nWith respect to HHS- conducted or supported research, OHRP has determined\nthat the following research is excepted from the single IRB mandate: (1)\ncooperative research conducted or supported by HHS agencies other than the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH), if an IRB approved the research before January\n20, 2020, or (2) cooperative research conducted or supported by NIH if either (a)\nthe NIH single IRB policy  does not apply, and the research was initially\napproved by an IRB before January 20, 2020, or (b) NIH excepted the research\nfrom its single IRB policy before January 20, 2020.\nCoop erative Research Approved Before\nJanuary 20, 2020\nIn May 2019, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the Council on\nGovernmental Relations (COGR), the Association of American Universities (AAU),\nand the Association of Public Land-Grant Universities (APLGU) wrote to the\ndirector of OHRP expressing concern regarding the application of the single IRB\nrequirement to cooperative research subject to the revised Common Rule when\nthe research was approved before January 20, 2020 (available at\nhttps://www.aamc.org/download/497410/data/finaljointassociationlettertoohrpo\nnsingleirb.pdf - PDF \n<https://www.aamc.org/download/497410/data/finaljointassociationlettertoohrponsingleirb.pdf> ).\nThe organizations asserted that much of the research community did not fully\nunderstand the way this requirement would operate, and informed OHRP that\nshi\u0000ing a multisite study in midstream to a single IRB review system would be\ndi\u0000icult and expensive. On this basis, the organizations requested that OHRP issue\nan exception to the single IRB requirement for cooperative research conducted\nunder the revised Common Rule and initiated before January 20, 2020.\nOHRP has considered this request. One of the objectives of the revised Common\nRule's single IRB requirement is to reduce administrative costs of cooperative\nresearch. For cooperative research that already has been initially approved by\nmultiple IRBs, the cost savings associated with reduced IRB reviews would not be\nachieved by making the single IRB requirement applicable to such cooperative\nresearch. Members of the regulated community report that transitioning[1]10/4/24, 7:14 PM November 21, 2019: Determination of Exception for Certain HHS | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/november-2019-exception-determination/index.html 3/7cooperative research from multiple IRBs to a single IRB would, conversely, be\ncostly for most institutions. Further, excepting such research from the single IRB\nmandate would not adversely a\u0000ect the rights and welfare of the research\nsubjects. For these reasons, OHRP has decided to except cooperative research\napproved before January 20, 2020, from the single IRB mandate. This general\nexception does not apply to NIH research; an NIH-specific exception is discussed\ninfra.\nOHRP has determined that a relatively small number of HHS protocols (other than\nNIH research) will be eligible for exception. OHRP surveyed the HHS agency, other\nthan NIH, that OHRP expects conducts or supports the majority of such human\nsubjects research. Based on the information provided by that agency, OHRP\nunderstands that this agency is supporting five ongoing cooperative research\nstudies that are subject to the revised Common Rule. Approximately three to five\nadditional cooperative research studies supported by this agency that would be\nsubject to the revised Common Rule are expected to be initiated before January\n20, 2020.\nCoop erative Research Conducted or\nSupported by NIH\nThe NIH policy on the use of a single IRB for multi-site research has been in e\u0000ect\nsince January 25, 2018. It requires all U.S. sites participating in NIH-funded multi-\nsite (i.e., two or more sites) studies involving non-exempt human subjects\nresearch where the sites are following the same protocol to use a single IRB for the\nreview. Exceptions to this policy are made where review by the proposed IRB is\nprohibited by a federal, tribal, or state law, regulation, or policy, or if there is a\ncompelling justification for the exception. NIH determines whether to grant an\nexception a\u0000er an assessment of the need. NIH's single IRB policy is largely\ncoextensive with the Common Rule single IRB requirement, although NIH\ndesigned its policy to exclude certain categories of cooperative research (e.g.,\ntraining protocols for activities that do not involve human subjects research at\ninitiation). NIH also has issued case-specific exceptions to its single IRB policy for\nparticular research studies. However, on January 20, 2020, the revised Common\nRule single IRB requirement will take e\u0000ect for certain studies, regardless of\nwhether they are subject to NIH's policy, which would require this NIH-conducted\nor supported research to use a single IRB review structure.10/4/24, 7:14 PM November 21, 2019: Determination of Exception for Certain HHS | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/november-2019-exception-determination/index.html 4/7As stated above, if more than one IRB initially reviewed and approved cooperative\nresearch, imposition of the single IRB mandate in mid-stream could result in\nincreased costs and burdens to regulated entities, rather than cost savings.\nExcepting such NIH-conducted or supported research from mandated single IRB\nreview will not adversely a\u0000ect the rights and welfare of the research subjects.\nFurther, NIH has given thoughtful consideration to these research contexts, and\nalready determined that single IRB review should not be required. NIH\ndeliberately structured its single IRB policy such that certain research would fall\noutside the scope of coverage. Likewise, in issuing case-by-case exceptions to its\nsingle IRB policy, NIH concluded that single IRB review is not appropriate for those\nparticular research contexts. Thus, OHRP has decided to except NIH cooperative\nresearch from the Common Rule single IRB mandate if either (a) the NIH single IRB\npolicy does not apply, and the research was initially approved by an IRB before\nJanuary 20, 2020, or (b) NIH excepted the research from its single IRB policy before\nJanuary 20, 2020. For more information on the NIH single IRB policy, see:\nhttps://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html\n<https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-16-094.html> .\nThis exception is an exercise of OHRP's enforcement discretion, as specifically\npermitted by 45 CFR 46.114(b)(2), that a\u0000ects relatively few research protocols for\na limited time. As required by 45 CFR 46.114(b)(2), OHRP determines and\ndocuments that using a single IRB is not appropriate for the described categories\nof research, and, for the reasons stated above, OHRP excepts this research from\nthe single IRB mandate. The full text of the exception is listed below, and may also\nbe found in the \"Single IRB Requirement\" tab in the \"Regulations, Policy, &\nPosting\" section of the OHRP website (see https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-\nand-policy/index.html <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/index.html>).10/4/24, 7:14 PM November 21, 2019: Determination of Exception for Certain HHS | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/november-2019-exception-determination/index.html 5/7II. Determination of Exception:\nRequired Use of Single Institutional\nReview Board for Cooperative\nResearch\nThe O\u0000ice for Human Research Protections (OHRP) has determined that for HHS\ncooperative research subject to the 2018 Requirements, and for purposes of 45\nCFR 46.114(b)(2)(ii), an institution may continue to use multiple IRBs, in lieu of a\nsingle IRB, for the following research:\n(1) Cooperative research conducted or supported by HHS agencies other than\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH), if an IRB initially approved the research\nbefore January 20, 2020.\n(2) Cooperative research conducted or supported by NIH if either:\na. the NIH single IRB policy does not apply, and the research was initially\napproved by an IRB before January 20, 2020, or\nb. NIH excepted the research from its single IRB policy before January 20,\n2020.\nNote that this determination is only made for purposes of section 46.114(b)(2)(ii) -\nnamely, for determining whether certain cooperative research may be excepted\nfrom the single IRB mandate. This determination does not prevent, nor should it\nbe viewed as discouraging, the voluntary use of a single IRB in cooperative\nresearch subject to the 2018 Requirements that would fall within the above two\ncategories. Further, note that category (2)(b), above, applies for the duration of\nNIH's exception from its policy for the particular research study; categories (1) and\n(2)(a) apply for the duration of the research.\n[1] See \"Guidance on Exceptions to the NIH Single IRB Policy\" released October 11,\n2017.

The full text of the determination appears below.Please note: A\u0000er May 11, 2023, the Public Health Emergency for\nCOVID-19 is no longer in e\u0000ect. Consequently, the exception to the\nsingle Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirement for certain\ncategories of cooperative research supported or conducted by HHS and\nsubject to the 2018 Requirements created in response to the\ncircumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be applied to\nadditional studies as of May 12, 2023. Research studies for which the\nHHS division supporting or conducting the research previously\napproved the use of the exception will continue to be excepted from the\nsingle IRB requirement, since the exception applies for the duration of\nthe research study. For more information see the announcement\nhere: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/news/announcements-and-news-\nreleases/2023/important-updates-about-the-covid-19-single-irb-\nexception.html <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/news/announcements-and-news-\nreleases/2023/important-updates-about-the-covid-19-single-irb-exception.html>10/4/24, 7:14 PM October 8, 2020: Exception to the Single IRB Review Requirements | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/october-2020-exception-determination/index.html 2/6I. Background\nSection 46.114 of the 2018 Requirements requires that any institution located in\nthe United States that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval\nby a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United\nStates (45 CFR § 46.114(b)(1)). Cooperative research projects are those projects\ncovered by the 2018 Requirements that involve more than one institution (45 CFR\n§ 46.114(a)). The compliance date for this requirement was January 20, 2020.\nThe 2018 Requirements provide that the Federal department or agency\nconducting or supporting cooperative research may except the research from the\nsingle IRB mandate. To do so, the Federal department or agency must both\ndetermine and document that using a single IRB is not appropriate for the\nparticular context (45 CFR 46.114(b)(2)(ii)).\nDue to the public health emergency posed by COVID-19, the O\u0000ice for Human\nResearch Protections (OHRP) is exercising its discretion, as specifically permitted\nby 45 CFR § 46.114(b)(2), to issue this exception to apply in the conditions outlined\nherein, on the basis that using a single IRB is not appropriate for this research\ncontext. We believe that this determination of exception is a statement of agency\npolicy that is not subject to the notice and comment requirements of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A)). For the same reasons\nexplained above, OHRP additionally finds that, even if this determination of\nexception were subject to the public participation provisions of the APA, prior\nnotice and comment is impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and\nthere is good cause to issue this determination of exception without prior public\ncomment and without a delayed e\u0000ective date (5 U.S.C. §53(b)(B) & (d)(3)).\nThis exception is applicable as of October 8, 2020\nII. Determination of Exception\nTo ensure that institutions conducting cooperative research are able to take\nadvantage of the most appropriate IRB review structure, OHRP has determined\nthat, for studies that are conducted or supported by HHS and subject to the 2018\nRequirements, and for purposes of 45 CFR 46.114(b) (2)(ii), an exception to the\nrequirement to use a single IRB is appropriate for the following category:[1]10/4/24, 7:14 PM October 8, 2020: Exception to the Single IRB Review Requirements | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/october-2020-exception-determination/index.html 3/6Cooperative research:\n1. that is ongoing or initially reviewed by the IRB during the Coronavirus Disease\n2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, as declared by the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services at\nhttps://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/2019-\nnCoV.aspx <https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/pages/2019-ncov.aspx>\n;\n2. where reliance on a single IRB would not be practical; and\n3. for which the HHS division supporting or conducting the research approves of\nthe use of this exception.\nThis exception applies for the duration of the research.\nOHRP has made this exception determination due to concerns regarding the\napplication of the single IRB requirement to cooperative research subject to the\n2018 Requirements when this research is initially reviewed or ongoing during the\nCOVID-19 public health emergency. The COVID-19 public health emergency has\ncreated unprecedented burdens and disruption to the research enterprise, while\nat the same time requiring urgent research responses that necessitate flexible\napproaches to oversight in order to provide vital information and to allow other\nresearch to continue where possible. This exception represents an e\u0000ort to\nprioritize the health and safety of both research subjects and investigators, and\nprovides flexibility to institutions in seeking IRB review due to the unique\nchallenges created by the COVID-19 outbreak.\nScenarios for which OHRP anticipates it may not be practical to rely on use of a\nsingle IRB for multi-site, cooperative research trials during the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic include (but are not limited to):10/4/24, 7:14 PM October 8, 2020: Exception to the Single IRB Review Requirements | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/october-2020-exception-determination/index.html 4/6Trials for which timely administration of an intervention for the rapidly\nemerging COVID-19 outbreak is paramount, but:\nresearch sites cannot be identified in advance due to the unpredictable\nnature of the exact location of the outbreak and patients cannot be moved\nto an existing trial site or to a newly established site without further\nincreasing public health exposure risks; or\ninstitutions lacking existing reliance agreements, especially those in\nunderserved or under-resourced areas, may face delays in starting the trial\nand in administration of the intervention while reliance agreements are\nnegotiated.\nTrials leveraging existing federally-supported trial networks to maximize\naccess to appropriate patients, but where each network is operating under a\ndi\u0000erent single IRB of record and negotiating reliance agreements between the\nnetworks and single IRBs could reduce the ability of qualified sites to access\nappropriate patients at the correct stage of disease.\nTrials in which a federal research agency wishes to participate as a research\nsite with non-federal (but federally-supported) sites but is legally prohibited\nfrom agreeing to certain terms in reliance agreements required by the non-\nfederal sites.\nA cooperative research study supporting the response to the COVID-19\noutbreak in which the lead site is engaged in administration of an intervention\nand in addition is receiving study-wide identifiable samples and/or data for\nthe purposes of determining risk factors linked to COVID-19 disease\nsusceptibility, severity, outcome, or for developing potential diagnostics or\ntherapeutics. The sites that would be engaged in the research may include\ninstitutions that do not have standing reliance agreements within a research\nnetwork and establishing new reliance agreements would cause unacceptable\ndelays as well as result in a lost opportunity to collect critical COVID-19\nsamples and data.\nTrials in which the lead site or IRB is unable to provide oversight due to\ndisruption in operations caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency, but\nother sites can continue, and selecting another site as the IRB of record would\nrequire renegotiation of reliance agreements with a new IRB of record, and the\nstudy would otherwise be required to halt until such agreements were in\nplace.10/4/24, 7:14 PM October 8, 2020: Exception to the Single IRB Review Requirements | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/october-2020-exception-determination/index.html 5/6Note that this exception determination is only made for purposes of section\n46.114(b)(2)(ii) - namely, for determining whether certain cooperative research\nmay be excepted from the single IRB mandate. This exception determination does\nnot prevent, nor should it be viewed as discouraging, the voluntary use of a single\nIRB in cooperative research subject to the 2018 Requirements that would fall into\nthe above category. HHS fully expects use of single IRB where possible even\nduring the COVID-19 public health emergency. Approved use of the flexibilities\nprovided under this exception do not change any other obligations under the 2018\nRequirements.\n[1] The term “2018 Requirements” refers to subpart A of 45 CFR part 46 as\npublished in the July 19, 2018 edition of the e-Code of Federal Regulations .

Where parental\npermission is to be obtained, the IRB may find that the permission of one parent is\nsu\u0000icient for research to be conducted under §46.404 or §46.405. Where research\nis covered by §§46.406 and 46.407 and permission is to be obtained from parents,\nboth parents must give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown,\nincompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal\nresponsibility for the care and custody of the child.\n (c) In addition to the provisions for waiver contained in §46.116 of subpart A, if the\nIRB determines that a research protocol is designed for conditions or for a subject\npopulation for which parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable\nrequirement to protect the subjects (for example, neglected or abused children), it\nmay waive the consent requirements in Subpart A of this part and paragraph (b) of\nthis section, provided an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children who\nwill participate as subjects in the research is substituted, and provided further\nthat the waiver is not inconsistent with federal, state, or local law. The choice of an\nappropriate mechanism would depend upon the nature and purpose of the\nactivities described in the protocol, the risk and anticipated benefit to the\nresearch subjects, and their age, maturity, status, and condition.\n (d) Permission by parents or guardians shall be documented in accordance with\nand to the extent required by §46.117 of subpart A.\n (e) When the IRB determines that assent is required, it shall also determine\nwhether and how assent must be documented.\n §46. 409 W ards.\n (a) Children who are wards of the state or any other agency, institution, or entity\ncan be included in research approved under §46.406 or §46.407 only if such\nresearch is:10/4/24, 7:25 PM Pre-2018 Requirements | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/regulatory-text/index.html 59/62“ (1) Related to their status as wards; or”\n“ (2) Conducted in schools, camps, hospitals,\ninstitutions, or similar settings in which the\nmajority of children involved as subjects are not\nwards.”\n (b) If the research is approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the IRB shall\nrequire appointment of an advocate for each child who is a ward, in addition to\nany other individual acting on behalf of the child as guardian or in loco parentis.\nOne individual may serve as advocate for more than one child.

Institutional Authority and Purpose  \n \nThese standard operating procedures govern the use of human subjects participating in \nresearch at Arizona State University (ASU) or by ASU faculty at other sites.  ASU’s \nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) has been established under  the authority of the \nNational Research Act and implemented by university Policy at RSP-201.University \nrequires that all research projects involving humans as subjects be reviewed, and \napproved by ASU ’s IRB prior to  implementing studies, including recruitment  and \nscreening activities.  \n \nFederal government regulations control human subjects research conducted at ASU. \nASU assure s that it complies with the federal regulations for federally funded, aided, or \n“otherwise regulated” human subjects research and University Policy regardless of \nfunding.  The University does this using the “Federalwide Assurance” method.   ASU \nPolicy at RSP 201 -01 provides for the protections of human subjects as participants in \nresearch.   \n The purpose of the IRB is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in bioscience and social -behavioral research. The IRB review s and \nprovides overs ight of such research to ensure that it meets the ethical principles and \nthat it complies with federal regulations that pertain to human subject protection s at \n45 \nCFR 46  and 21 CFR 50  and 21 CFR 56  (as applicable), and other pertinent regulations, \nguidance, state and local laws.  \n \nB. Scope  \n As a matter of policy, all ASU faculty, students, staff, and administrators are responsible for protecting the rights and well -being of human subjects in research. The following \nprinciples are the basis for ASU’s human subject research procedures . \n \n1. All res earch involving humans as subjects must protect the subjects' safety, \nprivacy, health, and welfare.  \n \n2. The benefit of the research proposed must outweigh the potential for risk to t he \nsubjects participating in the research. Only the IRB at ASU is authorized to make \nthis determination.  3. The participation of humans as research subjects must be voluntary. Voluntary is \ndefined as the subject and/or subject’s representative has given informed consent. Researchers must document  informed consent except where the law explicitly \nwaives such documentation as determined by the appropriate IRB . \n  4 4. A human subject surrenders no rights by participating in research. In no case \nshall a hum an subject lose any benefit or entitlement by refusing to participate. In \naddition, subjects may withdraw from research at any time without penalty . \n \n5. Researchers are responsible for protecting private information about human \nsubjects that is obtained during research.  Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule regulations may apply to some research performed at ASU. ASU is a \"hybrid entity\" with \"covered components\" which must comply  with the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \nof 1996 and the implementing regulations (45 CFR Parts 160, 162 and 164). The HIPAA Privacy Regulations will impact research projects involving protected health information, if  the information is obtained from one of the \"covered components\" or \nfrom another covered entity outside ASU, such as a hospital or pharmacy. Particularly in cases where a project is associated with a hospital or other clinical partner, HIPAA related issues may need to be addressed. In most cases the ASU IRB will defer to the clinical partner’s HIPAA requirements and will acc ept any \nnecessary forms as part of the ASU IRB submission. The preference of the ASU IRB is to defer under affiliation to the clinical partner for collaborative studies performed at a clinical site. The ASU IRB will accept the hospital or clinical partner requirements and forms as part of the ASU IRB protocol submission.  \n \n6. All researchers, whether students, faculty members or staff, are responsible for \ncomplying with these procedures and all applicable laws, regardless of where the research is performed.  \n 7. All researchers whether students, faculty members or staff are responsible for \nsafeguarding their data in accordance with data standards as promulgated by University Technology Office ( UTO ) \nhttps://getprotected.asu.edu/policy -\ncompliance/guidelines -procedures  \n \n  \nC. Updating  \n In the event of a regulatory, procedural,  or statutory change to governing regulations, \nthese procedures shall be construed to conform to that change. Changes should be brought to the attention of the IRB or Office of Research Integrity and Assurance ( ORIA ) \nand the procedures will be revised accordingly.   IRB members and researchers will \nhave access to the updated policies and procedures via a posting on the IRB website: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects\n \n    5 II. FEDERALWIDE ASSURANCE (FWA)  \n \nArizona State University, also referred to as the \"institution\" or “ASU” hereby gives assurance, as specified below, that it will comply with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations for the protection of human research subjects, 45 CFR Part 46, as amended to include provisions of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (56F R28003) as Subpart A, and as may be further amended during \nthe approval period for this Assurance. The coverage also applies to other Departments and Agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. Information about the FWA is posted on the IRB website: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects\n. \n \nA.  Ethical Principles  \n \n1. ASU is guided by the ethical principles regarding all research involving humans \nas subjects, as set forth in the report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (entitled: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research [the \"Belmont Report\"]), regardless of whether the research is subject to Federal regulation or with whom conducted or source of support (i.e. sponsorship).   2. All research performance sites under the auspices of ASU, domestic or foreign, \nwill be obligated by the University to conform to ethical principles which are at l east \nequivalent to those of this institution, as cited in the previous paragraph or as may be determined by the DHHS Secretary.  \n \nB. Institutional Policy  \n \n1. All requirements of Title 45, Part 46, of the Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR \n46) will be met for federally supported human subjects research. F unds for which our \nAssurance applies may not be expended for research involving human subjects unless the requirements of ASU’s Assurance have been satisfied.  \n 2. In accordance with 45 CFR 46, all research involving human subjects are \ncovered by ASU’s Assurance and will be reviewed and approved by ASU’s IRB \nwhich has been established under a Federalwide Assurance (FWA) with the Office \nfor Human Research Protections (OHRP).  The involvement of human subjects in research covered by our Assurance will not be permitted until an appropriate IRB has reviewed and approved the research protocol and informed consent has been obtained from the subject or the subject's legal representative.  \n 3. ASU assures  that before human subjects are involved in nonexempt research \ncovered by this policy, the IRB will give proper consideration to the:  \n \na. Risks to the subjects  \nb. Anticipated benefits to the subjects and others  \nc. Importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result   6 d. Informed consent process to be employed  \ne. Provisions to ensure the safety of subjects  \nf. Provisions to maintain privacy and confidentiality of subjects and their dat a \n \n4. Institutions that are not direct signatories to this Assurance are not authorized to \ncite ASU’s Assurance. ASU will ensure that other  such institutions and investigators \nnot bound by the provisions of DHHS -sponsored research will satisfactorily assure \ncompliance with 45 CFR 46, as required, as a prior condition for involvement in \nhuman subject research which is under the auspices of this institution.   \n 5. ASU will ensure that any of its affiliates materially engaged in the conduct of \nresearch involving human subjects will possess mechanisms to protect human research subjects that are at least equivalent to those procedures provided for in the ethical principles to which this institution is committed (see Part A).  \n \n6. ASU will comply with the requirements set forth in 45 CFR 46 § 114 of the \nregulations regarding cooperative research projects.  When research covered by ASU’s Assurance is conducted at or in cooperation with another entity, all provisions of our Assurance remain in effect for that research.  Acceptance of the terms must be (a) in writing, (b) recommended by an authorized official of this institution's  \nKnowledge Enterprise, and (c) approved and signed by an Institutional Official or \nInstitutional Official ’s Designee authorized to execute cooperative agreements \nbetween the institution and other organizations, to  establish reliance on IRBs of \nrecord for collaborative research (e.g., IRB Authorization Agreements, Individual \nInvestigator Agreements) .  \n \nThe ASU IRB will provide review and oversight for an external partner when the project covers collaborative work between ASU and an external entity (e.g. external entity receives federal award and subcontracts part of work to ASU which includes providing the IRB services or vice versa ).   Any decision to provide IRB oversight for \ncollaborators and any associated fees will be made on a case by case basis. Other requests by external entities will be referred to a private authorized IRB . \n 7. ASU will exercise appropriate administrative oversight to ensure that policies and \nprocedures designed for protecting the rights and wel fare of human subjects are \nbeing effectively applied in compliance with the FWA.  \n \nC. Applicability  \n \n1. ASU’s FWA applies to federally sponsored research involving human subjects, \nand all  other activities which, even in part, involve such research if one or more of \nthe following apply : \n a. Research is sponsored by ASU  \nb. Research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of ASU in connection with his or her institutional responsibilities   7 c. Research is conducted by or under the direction of any e mployee or agent of \nASU using any property or facility of ASU  \nd. Research involves the use of ASU’s non- public information to identify or \ncontact human research subjects or prospective subjects  \ne. All human subject research which is exempt under Section 101(b)(1- 6) or \n101(i) will be conducted in accordance with: (1) the Belmont Report, (2) \nASU’s administrative procedures to ensure valid claims of exemption, and (3) orderly accounting for such activities  \nf. Components of this University are bound by the provisions of  our Assurance. \nThose components which can be expected to participate in human subject research sponsored by DHHS or other Federal departments or agencies for which our Assurance will apply are identified under Assurance # FWA00009102 at  https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/irbs -and-assurances.html\n \ng. The FWA must be accepted by other Federal departments or agencies that are bound by the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects when appropriate for the research in question and therefore applies to all human subject research so sponsored.  Research that is neither conducted nor supported by a Federal department or agency but  is subject to regulation as \ndefined in Section 102(e) must  be reviewed and approved, in compliance with \nSections 101, 102, and 107 through 117.  \n \nD. Local Review , Affiliation Agreements, and Multisite research  \n The ASU IRB may enter into affiliation agreements with other institutions based on \nrecommendation and approval from the ASU Institutional Official  and/or IRB Manager . \nThe institutions may cover single protocols or enter into general agreements for reciprocity between institutions. Finalized agreements are recorded in the applicable study  record .  \n When another IRB is designated as the IRB of record, then the ASU IRB will rely on the review, approval, and continuing oversight by the responsible IRB. ASU requires that a local contextual review form and copy of the approved protocol be submi tted through \nthe ERA IRB module to the ASU IRB for local review (see https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects/forms\n).  \n \nE. Fee Structure  \n The ASU IRB charges a fee for protocols funded by private industry sponsors as well as \nprotocols submitted to external IRBs  in some cases.  There is no charge for ASU IRB \nreview of ASU research protocols funded from other sources or for unfunded research. \nThe fee is not based on whether the project is actually initiated, but rather on the fact that the project received review by the ASU IRB. The fee is paid up- front at the time of \nprotocol submission and covers the initial and subsequent review of amendments and adverse event reports during the 12- month period of approval. Investigators and/or \ndepartments are responsible for the payment of this fee at the time of protocol  8 submission. The payment schedule and information about payment options can be \nfound at:  https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects/special -considerations  \n For assistance in submitting payment , contact ORIA staff at 480 -965-6788 or \nasuirb@asu.edu\n. Payment is required before final IRB approval can be granted.  \n \nF. Special Circumstances  \n There are cases where researchers submit protocols for funding when the plans for human subjects research are not finalized. However, they will only conduct human subject’s  research if the project is funded.  In other cases, the first year of the project will \nbe designing the study. In these cases, the IRB will evaluate the situation and determine if the protocol can be excluded from review based on federal regulations at 45CFR46.118 of the Code of Federal Regulations which provides for grants where definite individual project -specific details for human subject participation are not yet \nfinalized .  When the circumstance is appropriate, the IRB can determine that IRB review \nis not required until details of human subjects participation is finalized. Additional information is available by contacting the IRB at asuirb@asu.edu\n. \n                           9  \n III. GENERAL INFORMATION  \n \nA. Overview \n \nASU is guided by the ethical principles regarding all research involving humans as subjects as set forth in the report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research entitled “Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research” (The Belmont Report).  \n Underlying ASU’s policy are the following basic principles embodied in the policy statement contained in part 46 of Title 45. These principles will serve to assist the Unive rsity in discharging its responsibilities, through its authorized representatives: the \nKnowledge Enterprise (KE), the Office for Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA), and the IRB, to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects, as well as to assist  \nfaculty engaged in relevant research from unknowingly committing unethical acts. ASU bears full responsibility for the performance of all research involving human subjects covered by this set of policies and procedures.   No member or staff supporting the IRB \nhas a business development function related to the organization.  \n \nB. Conduct of Research  \n Research involving human subjects is an important and necessary activity of the University and must be conducted in an ethical manner. Such research has the encouragement of the University when the following principles are fulfilled:  \n \n1. Risks are minimized by using the safest procedures consistent with sound research design.  \n 2. The privacy of the subject is protected,  and confidentiality of data is maintained.  \n 3. Before any person is a subject of research, information must be obtained from \nthat person that wishes to become a participant or  completed by a legally \nauthorized representative of the participant. This information includes an \ninformed, voluntary  consent , unless a waiver or alteration of authorization has \nbeen approved by the IRB.  \n \nThis involves a full and careful explanation in language that is understandable by lay persons. The consent of the subject must be obtained without duress, \ndeception (unless this is considered part of the research plan—refer below  for \ndetails ) or withholding of information. This means that the purpose of the \nresearch, procedures to be followed, possible  risks involved, and the benefits to \nresult from the activity  are clearly explained to the subject and the subject’s rights \nare clearly represented.  \n  10 In cases where the research design involves deception, an information letter  is \nused initially to obtain participants’ agreement to take part in the study, and a \ndebriefing should occur immediately after conclusion of participation. After the debriefing occurs the participants should be given the opportunity to consent or have their data withdrawn from use by researchers. In general, research involving deception and the use of these procedures is allowed if participation involves no more than minimal risk. This will be evaluated on a study -by-study  basis. \n 4. The subject should also be told that he/she is free to withdraw from the research at any time without penalty.  \n \nC. Review Process  \n Before any research project involving the use of human subjects can commence at ASU, the project must be reviewed and approved by the IRB. Under federal regulation, classroom activity, laboratory courses and/ or ‘field’ assignments  are normally not \nclassified as research, and typically are not reviewed by the IRB. Independent student research projects must, however, be reviewed by the IRB.  All proposals submitted to Federal agencies that require IRB review prior to submission must be reviewed and if \nrequired, approved by the IRB before proposal submission.  For Federal agencies that allow for just -in-time compliance oversight , the IRB will accept the protocol in \naccordance with agency directives.  Protocols must comply with the University's \nFederalwide Assurance, DHHS Policies and Regulations on Protection of Human Subjects, FDA regulations, and this document.  \n \nD. Principal Investigator  \n \nThe Principal Investigator (PI) must be a  regular faculty or staff member  per the \nResearch and Sponsored Projects Manual RSP 102: Principal Investigator Eligibility. (https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/rsp/rsp102.html ). In the event that the primary  \nresearcher is an undergraduate or graduate student , then the supervising faculty \nmember must act as the PI. It is the responsibility of the PI to make certain that all current policies and procedures governing the participation of humans as research subjects are adhered to in the research project. Supplemental to DHHS and FDA regulations or applicable law are ethical codes developed and adopted by various professional associations which will assist and guide investigators in various disciplines in protecting the rights of human subjects. They do not supplant or substitute for DHHS and FDA regulations or this document.  \n Graduate students, research assistants or others performing research activities which exceed minimal risk to research subjects, under the supervision of a faculty advisor, which has been approved by the IRB may be considered \"agents\" of the University for risk management purposes.  \n Principal investigators are responsible for supervising co- investigators and other key \npersonnel. A co- investigator is defined as anyone who has responsibility for:  the  11 project’s design, implementation, data collection, and/or data analysis. Key personnel \nare individuals who may have contact with study participants but who do not have \nprogram specific responsibilities.  \n   12 IV. ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITES  \n \nA. Knowledge Enterprise (KE)  \n \nIt is the responsibility of KE to assure that the policies and procedures for research \ninvolving human subjects are carried out in accordance with Federal Regulations.  The \nUniversity President appoints an Institutional O fficial. The University assumes the \nfollowing responsibilities:  \n \n1. Oversight of the human subject’s  protection program and the IRB.  \n2. Institutional determinations concerning sponsorship and certification.  \n3. Oversight for ensuring compliance with 45  CFR 46, 32 CFR 219 and 42 CFR 11. \n4.  Oversight for ensuring compliance with the Investigational New Drug or Device \nCertification Requirement. Researchers shall comply with the Food and Drug \nAdministration  (FDA), Investigational Drugs or Medical Devices in accordance \nwith 21 CFR 50, 21 CFR 56, 21 CFR 312, 21CFR 812 and International \nConference on Harmonization (ICH) as adopted by the FDA . \n \nB. Office of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA)  \n \nORIA provides support to the IRB and to investigators seeking review of their protocols and is responsible for the daily activities and operations of the IRB. ORIA Staff provide support to the IRB. These individuals include IRB staff including  the IRB Mana ger who \nare responsible for the day to day operations of the IRB. The ORIA has the following responsibilities and roles:  \n \n1. Receives IRB applications from investigators for research involving human subjects. Application forms for new submissions can be downl oaded from the \nIRB website: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects/forms\n. They are \nthen submitted into ERA IRB  module and an ORIA staff member is assigned to \nperform a revi ew of the submission.  \na. Reviewing applications to determine whether the study meets exemption criteria under 45 CFR 46.101.  The IRB Chair or IRB members can also make this determination.  \nb. Schedules  review of all non- exempt research protocols with the IRB Chair \nor a member of the IRB for review.  \nc. Disseminat es information about policies and procedures as well as \nproviding education about human subject’s  research.  Copies of the ASU \nprocedures for the review of human subject’s  research and Federal \nRegulations and Guidance are available to faculty, staff, administrators, \nstudents, subjects and all other interested persons. Each time a revision occurs, the most current version of the ASU procedures for the review of \nhuman subjects research is posted on the IRB website: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human-subjects/\n The website also \ncontains the IRB submission forms, FAQs, and other resources.   13 2. Promptly report s to the OHRP and FDA, through the Institutional Official, on a \nvariety of issues. In conjunction with this requirement, the University IRB must be \nprepared to receive and act on information received from a variety of sources, such as human subjects, research investigators, the Office of Research and Sponsored Projects Administration (ORSPA) or other institutional staff.  \n3. Makes IRB records accessible for inspection to authorized representatives of \nOHRP and FDA (and authorized institutional representatives) at reasonable times and  in a reasonable manner . Forwards copies to the agency when \nrequested by authorized representatives. Makes r ecords available for audit at \nany time. ORIA staff members may schedule a protocol audit with an investigator at any time. The audit findings are reviewed by/with the IRB Manager  and staff , \nIRB Chairs and committee and/or Institutional Official,  and when appropriate the \nOffice of General Counsel . Generally,  audits are done on a for -cause basis. Not -\nfor-cause audits may also be performed. The ORIA prepares and maintains \nadequate documentation of IRB activities including the following:  \na. Related  research proposals including those for studies determined to be \nexempt or determined not to constitute human subjects research, reviewed scientific evaluations, if any, that accompany the research proposals, approved consent documents, progress reports submitted by research investigators, and reports of adverse events and all other relevant and related materials.  \nb. Protocol modification documentation. \nc. C opies of IRB agendas and minutes  \ni. Records of continuing review activities.  \nii. Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the research investigators as indicated by 45 CFR46.115 (a) (4).  \niii. A list of IRB members as required by §46.108(a)(2)  per and, \n21CFR56. 107, and 21CFR56.115.  \niv. Written procedures for the IRB as required by §46.108(a)(3) and (4) \nand 21CFR56. 108(a) and (b)  \n \nThe ORIA provides for the maintenance of records , relating to a specific \nprotocol , for at least 3 years after termination of the last IRB  approval date. The \nstudies are stored within the ERA IRB module.  \n \n4. Reporting Requirements  \nThe ORIA will report promptly to the IRB, appropriate institutional officials, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an d any other sponsoring Federal department or agency head (as \nappropriate):  \na. Any injuries to human subjects or other unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others  \nb. Any serious or continuing noncompliance with the regulations or requirements of the  IRB, and/or  \nc. Any suspension or termination of IRB approval for research.  \n  14 5. Reporting Procedures - Researchers  \nFor reporting purposes, the University IRB and ORIA will follow the procedures \ndescribed below:  \na. Noncompliance: Investigators, study staff and researchers are responsible \nfor reporting non- compliance directly to the IRB. Any noncompliance by \nresearch investigators with the requirements of the IRB shall be reported promptly to the ORIA and IRB for appropriate f ollow- up.  The IRB will act \nin accordance with Standard Operating Procedures (SOP ’s) 07-001 Non-\nCompliance  with IRB Policies and Procedures and SOP 07- 002 Reporting \nRequirement for Unanticipated Events, Serious and Continuing Non-Compliance and/or suspension or termination of IRB approval. These  \ndocuments are internal documents and outline responsibilities for reporting noncompliance. ASU investigators will be notified of \nnoncompliance in accordance with these procedures.  \nb. Injuries to human subjects : Information received by the IRB concerning \ninjuries to subjects shall be reported promptly to the ORIA and IRB for appropriate follow -up. \nc. Unanticipated problems or complaints : Information received by the IRB \nconcerning unanticipated problems or complaints involving ris ks to \nsubjects or others shall be reported promptly to the ORIA and IRB for appropriate follow -up. Reportable events to the IRB are submitted as \n“reportable new information” through the ERA IRB portal and reviewed through the portal.  \nd. When reviewing non- compliance the IRB is responsible for determining \nwhether a study  modification is required to address newly -identified risks.  \nThe IRB may also require additional actions to reduce the risks to participants such as, but not limited to:  \ni. Suspension of the research  \nii. Termination of the research  \niii. Notification of current subjects (required when such information might  relate to subjects’ willingness to continue to take part in the \nresearch)  \niv. Require that additional information be provided to subjects who have completed study procedures  \nv. Modification of the research study  \nvi. Modification of the information disclosed during the consent process  \nvii. Require re- consenting of current subjects  \nviii. Monitoring of the research \nix. Monitoring of the consent process  \nx. Require implementation of a Data Safety Monitoring Board, or  other \nmonitoring entity  \nxi. Shorten the continuing review cycle  \n \n6. Reporting Procedures -IRB and ORIA   15 a. Suspension or termination of IRB approval : Whenever the IRB suspends \nor terminates approval of research protocols, the ORIA shall include a \nstatement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall report the action promptly to the PI, Department Chair ( or equivalent ), College Dean,  \nuniversity  Leadership and Federal Government where applicable.  The \nInstitutional  Official or designee can issue a suspension of IRB approval or  \ntermination when in the opinion of the IRB Chair, Manager  or committee \nsubjects may be at risk of adverse events on their rights and welfare.  \nb. Reporting requirements : The ORIA shall be responsible for promptly \nreporting information, as appropriate, to the IRB, OHRP (where applicable), FDA (where applicable), research investigators and department heads regarding issues of noncompliance. Information may \ncome from sources such as human subjects, re search investigators, the \nIRB or other institutional staff.   \n7. Investigator Responsibilities  \na. Principal investigators (PIs) are responsible for the conduct of the research and are responsible for ensuring that the rights and welfare of subjects are protected. PIs are responsible for placing the consent documents signed by research subjects in a repository approved by the IRB. The PI is responsible for maintaining, in a designated on- campus \nlocation (unless an alternate storage facility is approved by the IRB), complete records of all documentation relating to the study which is conducted for at least 3 years after completion of the research. All records and documentation must be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized officials of ASU  including the IRB, ORIA, DHHS, the FDA (as \nappropriate),  and regulatory agencies and/or study sponsors of  the \nresearch protocol in question.  \n \nWhen an investigator leaves ASU prior to the completion of a study, the investigator is responsible for initiating mutually satisfactory arrangements with University administration as to the disposition and storage of c onsent \nforms and other study -related materials ,  closing out  or transferring the \nstudy as needed.  \n \nb. Statements of significant new findings developed during the course of the research which may relate to the subjects' willingness to continue participation must be provided to subjects, as required by 45 CFR 46.116( c)(5) and to the IRB.  Investigators should also demonstrate \ndiligence when  informing participants of any new findings after their \nparticipation has ended as reflected in the continui ng review/study closure \nprocess. This may occur due to analysis of data that reveals information \nthat may affect participants.  \n \nc. Principal investigators are responsible for reporting the progress of the research to the Office of Research Integrity and Assur ance  (ORIA)  as \nnecessary  and in the manner prescribed by the IRB,. The IRB will  16 determine the frequency for reporting the progress based on the nature of \nthe study.  \n \nd. Principal investigators are responsible for: promptly reporting, in writing, to the IRB, t hrough the ORIA any injuries to human subjects, or any \nunanticipated problems which involve risks to the human research subjects or others.  \n \ne. Principal investigators are responsible for req uesting, in writing , any \nproposed changes in research activities to the IRB through the ORIA \nbefore such changes are implemented. Researchers must submit the \nmodification  to the IRB through ERA IRB. Modifications in research during \nthe period for which IRB approval has already been given shall not be initiated by research investigators without IRB review and approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject. In such occurrence the IRB is to be notified as soon as possible (within 5 \ndays) through the ORIA.   \n \nResearchers should contact ORIA  (asuirb@asu.edu\n) with questions \nregarding the modification process. Modifications to full board studies that do not increase the risk may  be reviewed under  expedited review  \ncategories . Those changes that increase risk to participants are reviewed \nby the convened IRB  as a full board study. As part of the review process, \nthe reviewer will determine whether the changes are substantial and require review by the convened IRB.  \n \nf. Principal investigators are responsible for reporting promptly to the IRB \nany serious or continuing non- compliance with the requirements of \nUniversity policy and procedures in this document or the determinations of the IRB.  \n \ng. To facilitate the review of research and the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects, occasionally research investigators may be asked to attend IRB meetings to assist IRB members with any concerns regarding the protocol.  \n \nh. The principal investigator shall be responsible for notifyi ng the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) and the IRB through the ORIA whenever it is anticipated that an investigational new drug or device exemption will be required.  \n \ni. All projects reviewed and approved prior to the implementation date remain under the regulations in effect prior to January 2019until their next regularly scheduled continuing review.  At the time of continuing review , \neach study will be reviewed for transition to the new regulations.   17 Grandfathered projects will be provided information on transitioning to the \ncurrent regulations at the time of continuing review (if applicable).  \n \n   18 V. TRAINING  \n \nA. Federalwide Assurance and Federal Training Requirements  \n \nThe ASU Federalwide Assurance requires education on the protections of human research participants for all investigators conducting human subjects research.  Before the study can be approved, investigators must provide documentation of education completed for every one who has contact with subjects or research data in the proposed \nresearch project. Additionally , the Assurance requires training for the IRB Chair and \nmembers and staff who support the IRB process.  \n Additional information on the NIH policy regarding training is available at https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/training- and-resources.htm\n \n Information for research ethics education with certification is located in the CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) site at: https://www.citiprogram.org/default.asp?language=english\n.   \n Information about Department of Defense training requirements can be found at: https://www.med.navy.mil/About- Us/Human -Research- Protection- Program/\n  \n Requirements for Human Subjects Protection (HSP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Training for Clinical Research Site Personnel can be found at:  \nhttps://www.citiprogram.org/default.asp\n \nhttps://ocr.od.nih.gov/clinical_research_training.html  \n \nB. Training for Investigators  \n The ASU IRB extends this training requirement to all ASU faculty, researchers, staff, and students conducting human subjects research.  All individuals who have any responsibilities for the research project, who have contact with subjects, or who have access to research data at any time during the conduct of the study must document compliance with the ASU IRB training requirement.  As a prerequisite for compliance with the pol icy, investigators must provide documentation that they and all relevant \nmembers of their research team have completed through CITI course for human subject \nresearch protections  within the past 4 years .  \n In some circumstances, other training certificates or sessions will satisfy the training requirement such as attending an outreach session conducted by ORIA.  As part of a \nprotocol’s pre- review , staff from ORIA and the IRB reviewer will review the training \ndocumentation to determine whether it meets ASU’s standards or if additional training is required. Researchers who collaborate with non- ASU personnel should contact ORIA \nregarding training requirements. The IRB website also includes various educational resources and links to University Policy, Federal Regulations and Guidance and various ethical codes as well as an entire section on training: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects\n.     19  \nTraining certification is valid for 48  months.  \n PI’s conducting research in foreign countries and having oversight  of non -English \nspeaking research staff are responsible for submitting a curriculum for training their staff in the ethical conduct of research for review and approval by the IRB. They must \nprovide such training to their staff before they  begin research activities  with humans, \nand should continue monitoring their research staff for compliance with these \nprocedures.  \n  \nC. Training for IRB Members  \n As a requirement for their appointment to the IRB, the IRB chair and members (including alternates) are also required to take human subjects training via CITI at :  \nhttps://www.citiprogram.org/default.asp\n.   \n However, in special circumstances, other forms of training may be accepted. Members \nare provided reference training materials such as the Institutional Review Board \nHandbook and relevant research articles. Ongoing education is provided routin ely at \nconvened meetings . The IRB Chair is encouraged to attend at least one national level \nprofessional meeting related to human subject protections and funds may be made \navailable by ORIA to cover the expense of attending.  \n \nD. Training for Office of Research Integrity and Assurance Staff Members  \n All staff in the Office of Research Integrity and Assurance with responsibilities for supporting the IRB is required to be familiar with the following:  \n \n1. ASU Procedures for the Review of Human Subjects Research  \n2. IRB website  \n3. Applicable Federal Regulations  \n \nAttendance at regional and national meetings related to human subjects is encouraged for all staff.  \n   20 VI. IRB MEMBERSHIP  \n \nA. Membership Composition  \n \nEach IRB is a standing committee of ASU. The IRB must be composed of sufficient members with varying backgrounds to assure complete and adequate review of research projects involving human subjects. In addition to a balance of research expertise, the IRB shall also include persons able to determine the acceptability of a research proposal with respect to institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, standards of professional conduct and practice, and community viewpoints.  \n The IRB is primarily comprised of representatives from the colleges and departments involved in and  experienced with research projects involving human subjects as \nparticipants. The IRB includes at least one individual who is unaffiliated with ASU and \nwho is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.  The person represents the perspective of research participants . \n The IRB will be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members, and the diversity of the members' backgrounds (including consideration of the racial and cultural backgrounds of members and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes ) to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the \nrights and welfare of human subjects.  \n If the IRB regularly reviews research that involves a vulnerable category of subjects as defined by the Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46), the IRB shall  include one or more \nindividuals whose background is in protecting the welfare of those subjects.  \n No ASU IRB may consist entirely of men or entirely of women, or entirely of members of one profession. The IRB shall include at least one member whose primar y concerns are \nin nonscientific areas; for example: lawyers, ethicists, or members of the clergy. The IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.  The IRB will include at least 5 members as required by the Federal \nRegulations . The Institutional Official and the IRB Manager and Administrator may \nserve as alternate members of the IRB. The IO may appoint alternate members for the \nmembers when there is an individual who has a similar background to the regular member. Alternate members have the same training requirements as regular members.  \n The members shall be identified to the Federal Government by name, earned degrees (if any), position or occupation, representative capacity, and pertinent experience indicative of members' anticipated contribution to IRB deliberations. Membership rosters \nare maintained by ORIA  and posted on the Provost website\n. \n No IRB may have a member participating in its initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. The IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special  21 areas to assist in the review of complex issues which require expertise beyond or in \naddition to that available on the IRB. These individuals may not vote with the University IRB. All guests are at the invitation of the IRB Chair and/or IRB members.   Guests must \nbe approved by the IRB Chair  and/or Institutional Official , and any IRB member may \nrequest approval from the Chair to bring a guest.  At any scheduled IRB meeting, at the \nrequest of the IRB Chair or any IRB member, the meeting will move into executive session.  \nB. Method of Appointment  \n The administrative authority for the protection of human subjects at Arizona State University is delegated by the University President to the Institutional Official (IO). The \nmembers of the University IRB are nominated by the IO  in consultation with Chairs, and \nother stakeholders . Credentials of the members and gaps on the committee are \nconsidered when selecting the members. The IRB is a standing committee of the \nUniversity and is administratively responsible to the Institutional Official. Appointments to the IRB normally are for a period of one year and may be  renewable.  \n Membership terms are staggered - to ensure continuity within the committee. In \nadvance of appointments to the IRB, membership is reviewed by the Institutional \nOfficial , IRB Chair  and other stakeholders . The IRB Chair generally serves for a one -\nyear renewable term, coinciding with the academic calendar.  \n  \nC. Responsibility of Members  \n IRB member’s primary responsibility is the protection of the rights and welfare of the individuals  who are participants in research. IRB members are expected to be versed in \nregulations governing human subject protections, biomedical and behavioral research ethics, and IRB policies and procedures . \n Members are expected to attend majority  of the meetings . Members  are expected to \nnotify the ORIA IRB staff of unavailability for a previously confirmed assignment, i.e. \nconvened meeting attendance.  \n When possible, send  the member’s written review to ORIA IRB staff when attendance is \nnot possible due to an emergency  arising after the meeting agenda is distributed.  \n Members are expected to pursue current knowledge of human subjects regulations . \n \nD. Evaluation  \n  \nIRB membership participation is evaluated annually as part of the appointment process  \nto ensure appropriate cov erage for topical areas of research is provided. The evaluation \nis done by the ORIA Asst. Director, IRB Manager , the Institutional Official  and \nCommittee Chairs .  Evaluation criteria includes knowledge base of the committee , and  22 individual skills when appropriate.  If area s of improvement are identified during the \nevaluation an enhanced education and development plan will be developed to improve \nand monitor the individual’s and IRB’s knowledge, skills and performance. Recommendati ons for continued appointment are sent to the Institutional Official for \nacceptance. Each member receives an annual appointment renewal or thank you letter . \n                    \n                \n \n \n   23 VII. REVIEW PROCEDURES  \nThe ASU IRB must review and approve all research activities involving human subjects \nbefore data collection can begin.  \n  IRB exempt wizard:  \n \nAs of December 19th 2022, ASU IRB has implemented a Wizard tool to streamline the \nIRB review process for studies that fall under one or more exempt categories.  The IRB  \nhas set the following criteria for researchers to submit their studies through the Wizard – \n \n  \nCriteria*:  \n1. Unfunded research (studies that are funded by federal agencies, industries, \nfoundations and local partners are not eli gible)  \n2. Not a clinical trial  \n3. Single site study (only conducted at ASU)  \n4. Participants are adults, non- military, non - Native American, non- prisoner \npopulation (18 years or older)  \n5. Single component of data collection (surveys/interviews/focus groups etc.)  \n6. Resear chers do not have a dual role (conduct research on participants that they \nsupervise/oversee)  \n7. Study conducted in the U.S.  \n8. Research does not involve sensitive topics related to drug/alcohol use,   sexual \nbehavior, mental health, criminal behavior, immigration  status, personal financial \ninformation  \n9. Research does not involve other info that could put participants at risk of \ncriminal/civil liability  \n10. Research involves use of secondary human subjects data that are publicly \navailable  \n Once the Wizard makes a determination, researchers are requested to submit a copy of this determination into the ERA IRB module to receive a formal IRB approval letter.  \nAudits of studies determined exempt by the Wizard will be done  on a periodic basis  to \nensure compliance.  \n Studies that  do not meet criteria for a determination through the Wizard go through  the \nregular ASU IRB review process  as identified further below . \n Non-wizard/regular review process:  \n There are three categories of IRB review for research activities provided under federal regulations: 1) exempt review, (with/without limited review) , 2) expedited review, 3 ) full \nboard review.   24  \n After review of the study, an IRB Coordinator, the IRB Administrator, or other authorized staff member in ORIA shall recommend whether the research protocol meets the criteria necessary for designating Exempt status, Expedited Review, or Full Board review. This responsible reviewer m ay consult with the IRB Chair and/or members as necessary in \nmaking this determination. In some cases, protocols may be determined to “not be human subjects research” as defined by 45  CFR 46 and the investigators will receive \nnotification of this determination.  \n During the review process, Institutional Review Board (IRB) members review applications to determine if each research study has the necessary resources to protect subjects’ rights and welfare. In the process of evaluating adequate resources, the IRB  \nconsiders the following: monetary and non- monetary resources, provisions for monetary \nresources if the study is unfunded, whether there are adequate staff, including expertise and qualifications to conduct the research, need for and access to counseling, medical, \nor health care for subjects, confidentiality and necessary safeguards to protect privacy of subjects (e.g., space for consent and process) and confidentiality of data (e.g., physical and electronic records), and if the resources described are adequate to protect subjects effectively.  \n \nA. Exempt  and Limited IRB  Review  \n \nReview under these criteria are conducted as defined by 45  CFR 46.104 . If the study is \nnot found exempt, it must go through expedited or full board review. The IRB has developed guidelines pertaining to exempt research that are posted on the IRB website. Studies that meet criteria for exemption must be submitted for review by the IRB.  \n \n1. Categories of  Research Activities : \nI. Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational s ettings, \nthat specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to \nadversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or \nthe assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most \nresearch on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research \non the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, \ncurricula, or classroom management methods.  \nII. Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, \ndiagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or \nobservation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least \none of the following criteria is met:  \na. The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a \nmanner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be \nascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects . \nb. Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research \nwould not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil  25 liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, \neducational advancement, or reputation. \nc. The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a \nmanner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be \nascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an \nIRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required \nby §46.111(a)(7).  \nIII. Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the \ncollection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written \nresponses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject \nprospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least \none of the following criteria is met:  \na. The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a \nmanner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be \nascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects . \nb. Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research \nwould not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil \nliability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, \neducational advancement, or reputation. \nc. The information obt ained is recorded by the investigator in such a \nmanner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be \nascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an \nIRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required \nby §46.111(a)(7).  \ni. For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions \nare brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, \nnot likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the \nsubjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects \nwill find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all \nsuch criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral \ninterventions would include having the subjects play an online \ngame, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, \nor having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of \nreceived cash between themselves and someone else.  \nii. If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the \nnature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not \napplicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a \nprospective agreement to participate in research in \ncircumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will \nbe unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the \nresearch.  \nIV. Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary \nresearch uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if \nat least one of the following criteria is met:  \na. The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are \npublicly available .  26 b. Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is \nrecorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the \nhuman subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through \nidentifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the \nsubjects, and the investigator will not re- identify subjects . \nc. The research involves only information collection and analysis involving \nthe investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is \nregulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the \npurposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are \ndefined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” \nas described under 45 CFR 164.512(b) . \nd. The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or \nagency using government -generated or government -collected \ninformation obtained for non-research  activities, if the research \ngenerates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on \ninformation technology that is subject to and in compliance with section \n208(b) of the E -Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of \nthe identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part \nof the activity will be maint ained in systems of records subject to the \nPrivacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information \nused in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.  \nV. Research and demonstration projects  that are conducted or supported by a \nFederal department or agency, or otherwise subject to the approval of \ndepartment or agency heads (or the approval of the heads of bureaus or other \nsubordinate agencies that have been delegated authority to conduct the \nresearch and demonstration projects), and that are designed to study, evaluate, \nimprove, or otherwise examine public benefit or service programs, including \nprocedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs, possible \nchanges in or alternatives to those programs or procedures, or possible \nchanges in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those \nprograms. Such projects include, but are not limited to, internal studies by \nFederal employees, and studies under contracts or consulting arrangements, \ncooperative agreements, or grants. Exempt projects also include waivers of \notherwise mandatory requirements using authorities such as sections 1115 and \n1115A of the Social Security Act, as amended.  \na. Each Federal department or agency conducting or supporting the \nresearch and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly \naccessible Federal Web site or in such other manner as the department \nor agency head may determine, a list of the research and \ndemonstration projects that the Federal department or agency conducts \nor supports under this provision. The research or demonstration project \nmust be published on this list prior to commencing the research \ninvolving human subjects.  \nb. [Reserved]  \nVI. Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies:   27 a. If wholesome foods without additives are consumed  \nb. If a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the \nlevel and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or \nenvironmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by \nthe Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental \nProtection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture.  \nVII. Storage or maintenance for secondary research for which broad consent \nis required: Storage or maintenance of identifiable private information or \nidentifiable biospecimens for potential secondary research use if an IRB \nconducts a limited IRB review and makes the determinations required by \n§46.111(a)(8).  \nVIII. Secondary research for  which broad consent is required: Research involving the \nuse of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for secondary \nresearch use, if the following criteria are met:  \na. Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research \nuse of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens \nwas obtained in accordance with §46.116(a)(1) through (4), (a)(6), and \n(d). \nb. Documentation of informed consent or waiver of documentation of \nconsent was obtained in accordance with §46 .117. \nc. An IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determination \nrequired by §46.111(a)(7) and makes the determination that the \nresearch to be conducted is within the scope of the broad consent \nreferenced in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section; and (iv) The \ninvestigator does not include returning individual research results to \nsubjects as part of the study plan. This provision does not prevent an \ninvestigator from abiding by any legal requirements to return individual \nresearch results.  \n \n2. Submission Req uirements : Researchers whose studies fall into one of the \nexemption categories must submit either a Social Behavioral Application or \nBioscience Application to ORIA for review.  \n \nApplications for exempt status are  submitted through the ERA IRB module . \nResearch which qualifies for exempt status does not require a written informed consent form. It is the recommendation of the IRB that a short form consent template  be utilized for exempt research that informs the respondent of the \nelements of informed consent. Copies of  questionnaire, survey outline (written or \nverbal) and any other documentation is to be submitted with the application, supporting the determination of exempt status.  \n \nExempt Review /Limited IRB review Procedures  \nThe determination of an exempt status can be made by an authorized ORIA staff member, IRB Chair , or their designee.  Designee is  28 determined by the IRB Chair or, in his or her absence, the IRB \nManager .  Applications which have been determined to be Exempt a re \nlisted in the IRB agenda on a regular basis and held on file electronically. IRB members receive a list of studies that were determined to be exempt at each IRB meeting. Per 2018 Common Rule,there is a requirement  for a limited IRB review  for certain ex empt \nreview categories. These categories are:  \ni. Exempt (d)(2) research involving interviews, observations, \nsurveys, interviews that are identifiable  \nii. Exempt (d)(3) research involving benign interventions that are \nidentifiable (directly or through links) and the responses may be damaging to the subject’s reputation, financial standing, employability, educational advancement, criminal or civil liability  \niii. Exempt (d)(7) involving storage or maintenance of identifiable \nprivate information or biospecimens for secondary research for which broad consent is not required  \niv. Exempt (d)(8) involving secondary research for which broad \nconsent is required  \n \n3. Turnaround time: Exempt stud ies, take approximately 1 – 2 weeks to review and \napprove from the date received in the Office of Research Integrity and Assurance.  \n \n4. Notification to Researchers : For studies determined to be exempt  and those \nrequiring only limited review, researchers recei ve system notification through the \nERA module. The notification include s the protocol number and the category or \ncategories of review . \na. Recordkeeping: When a protocol is determined to be exempt /reviewed \nunder limited review , the study file is maintained in the ERA IRB module .  \nb. The ASU IRB does not issue expiration dates for studies determined to meet exempt /l imited review criteria. Researchers should contact the IRB \nat (480) 965- 6788 or at asuirb@asu.edu\n with any questions pertaining to \nmodifications to research determined to meet exemption criteria.  \n \nB. Expedited Review  \n Research activities involving no more than minimal risk and in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the following categories (carried out through standard methods) may be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedure authorized in 46.110 of 45 CFR Part 46.  \n \n1. Categories of Expedited Review  \nThe IRB may use the Expedited Review procedure to review minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized.  Similarly, modifications and amendments to an approved study that contain only insignificant changes  from the currently approved protocol may be approved  29 through the Expedited Review procedure.  The only other research for which the \nIRB may use an Expedited Review procedure is that which involves no more \nthan minimal risk to the subjects and in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the following categories:  \nI. Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met. \na. Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312 ) is not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that \nsignificantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)  \nb. Research on medical devices for which (i) an investigational device exemption application (21 CFR Part 812) is not required; or (ii) the medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.  \nII. Collection of blood sampl es by finger stick, heel stick, ear st ick, or venipuncture \nas follows : \na. From  healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For \nthese subjects, the amounts drawn may not exceed 550 ml in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more f requently than 2 times per \nweek  \nb. From other adults and children, considering the a ge, weight, and health \nof the subjects, the collection procedure, the amount of blood to be collected, and the frequency with which it will be collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg in an 8 -week  period and collection may not occur more frequently \nthan 2 times per week  \nIII. Prospective collection of biological specimens for research purposes by noninvasive means.  \na. Hair and nail clippings in a nondisfiguring manner  \nb. Deciduous teeth at time of exfoliation or if routine patient care indicates a \nneed for extraction  \nc. Permanent teeth if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction \nd. Excreta and external secretions (including sweat)  \ne. Uncannulated saliva collected either in an unstimulated fashion or \nstimulated by chewing gumbase or wax or by applying a dilute citric \nsolution to the tongue  \nf. Placenta removed at delivery  \ng. Amniotic fluid obtained at the time of rupture of the membrane prior to or \nduring labor  \nh. Supra-  and subgingival dental plaque and calculus, provided the \ncollection procedure is not more invasive than routine prophylactic \nscaling of the teeth and the process is accomplished in accordance with \naccepted prophylactic techniques  \ni. Mucosal and skin cells collected by buccal scraping or swab, skin swab, \nor mouth washings   30 j. Sputum collected after saline mist nebulization.  \n \nIV. Collection of data through noninvasive procedures (not involving general \nanesthesia or sedation) routinely employed in clinical practice, excluding procedures involving x -rays or microwa ves. Where medical devices are \nemployed, they must be cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally eligible for expedited review, including studies of cleared medical dev ices for \nnew indications.) . Examples include:  \na. Physical sensors that are applied either to the surface of the body or at a \ndistance and do not involve input of significant amounts of energy into the subject or an invasion of the subjects privacy  \nb. Weighing or testing sensory acuity  \nc. Magnetic resonance imaging  \nd. Electrocardiography , electroencephalography, thermography, detection of \nnaturally occurring radioactivity, electroretinography, ultrasound, diagnostic infrared imaging, doppler blood flow, and echocardiography  \ne. Moderate exercise, muscular strength testing, body composition \nassessment, and flexibility testing where appropriate given the age, weight, and health of the individual.  \n \nV. Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens)  that \nhave been collected, or will be collected solely for non -research  purpos es \n(such as medical treatment or diagnosis). (NOTE: Some research in this \ncategor y may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of \nhuman subjects. 45 CFR 46.101(b) (4). This listing refers only to research that is not exempt.)  \n \nVI. Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.  \n \nVII. Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior (including, but not limited to, research on perception, cognition, motivation, identi ty, language, \ncommunication, cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior) or  research \nemploying survey, interview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies. (NOTE: Some \nresearch in this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the \nprotectio n of human subjects. 45 CFR 46.101(b) (2) and (b) (3). This listing \nrefers only to research that is not exempt.)  \n \nVIII. Continuing review of research previously approved by the convened IRB as \nfollows : \na. The research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects  all \nsubjects have completed all  research- related interventions, and the \nresearch remains active only for long -term follow -up of subjects   31 b. Where no subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been \nidentified  \nc. Where the remaining research activities are limited to data analysis.  \n \nIX. Continuing review of research, not con ducted under an investigational new \ndrug application or investigational device exemption where categories two (2) \nthrough eight (8) do not apply but the IRB has determined and documented at \na convened meeting that the research involves no greater than mini mal risk \nand no additional risks have been identified.  \n The IRB also has the additional procedures related to DEXA and blood draws.  \n \nBlood Draws  are eligible for expedited review  \n• If weight <110 pounds:   the amount drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or \n3 ml per kg in an 8- week  period and collection * may not occur more frequently \nthan 2 times per week  \n• For weight ≥110 pounds:  \nRequirements:    \no <550 ml extracted per 8 weeks and collection * may not occur more frequently \nthan 2 times per week  \no Insertion of a needle must be by a trained/certified phlebotomist or health practitioner (e.g., RN, RT, MD)  \no Insertion of catheter must be by an RN or other practitioner with this in their scope of practice and not extend past 8 hours.    \n *Details:  \n1. Collection’ is defined as acquiring blood for a specified outcome measure and does not generally exceed an 8- hour period.   For example, ‘post -prandial’ \nglycemia, an OGTT, or fasting glucose are common outcome measures in diabetes research.  \n2. Require full board review of venous blood draws if any of the requirements are not met.  \n3. Funded and unfunded studies will follow the same guidelines  \n \nDEXA  \nThe ASU IRB reviews studies by expedited review with adults that involve DEXA if \nall other criteria for expedited review are met. After discussion the committee agreed that if the use of DEXA is justified, these protocols can be considered under expedited criteria if the number of DEXA sessions does not exceed 2 spaced by at least four weeks. This does not apply to federally  funded studies or studies involving \nminors  \n \n2. Expedited Review Submission Requirements  \nResearchers should complete either a Social Behavioral Application or a Bioscience Application depending on the area of the research. Forms can be found at: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects\n. Researchers then submit the   32 application using ERA IRB.  In addition to submitting the IRB application, the  \nresearchers must submit their recr uitment materials, data collection tools, informed \nconsent document and funding proposal (where applicable).  \n \nThe Bioscience IRB is responsible for reviewing research involving invasive procedures  (saliva, tissue, urine, or blood samples etc.), exercise science, dietary \nmanipulation, human physiology, and studies that evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a medical  product or procedure.  The Social Behavioral IRB is \nresponsible for reviewing research in  behavioral or social science examining topics \nsuch a s behavior, non- medical issues, opinions, personal and social history, and \neducational practice.   Researchers who are not sure what form to submit should \ncontact the ORIA for advice.  \n  Expedited Review Procedures  \nExpedited review shall be conducted by the IRB Chair or by an experienced IRB member designated to conduct the review on the Chair’s behalf. Only individuals with the appropriate discipline -based  experience, knowledge and \nskills are assigned as designated reviewers. For minor modifications to \nstudies such as changes in study personnel or for studies closed to the enrollment of new participants, these submissions can be reviewed by an alternate mem ber of the IRB . The IRB member(s) conducting the expedited \nreview may exercise all the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewer(s) \nmay not disapprove the research. The reviewer(s) shall refer any research protocol which the reviewer(s) would have di sapproved to the full board for \nreview as well as any protocol that does not meet criteria for expedited \nreview.  \n3. Expedited Review Turnaround Time  \nExpedited studies take approximately 2- 4 weeks to re view and approve from \nthe date received in the Office of Research Integrity and Assurance \ndepending on the quality of the information provided in the original application \nand resear chers’ responsiveness to staff members’ queries.  \nI. Notification to Researchers : Researchers will receive notification of study \napproval by email and consent forms and supplemental material watermarked \nwith the IRB approval date and expiration date. The approval notice will list the type of review,  approval date, expiration date.  \nII. Notification to IRB : In accordance with 45 CFR 110(c), the IRB receives a \nreport listing all studies that are approved by expedited review. This report is \ndistributed to members  at regular IRB meetings  and will include  exempt and \nexpedited studies  as well as those that are determined not to require IRB \nreview.  \nIII. At a convened IRB meeting, any member may request that an activity which \nhas been approved under the Expedited or Exempt procedure be reviewed by \nthe IRB in accordance with non- expedited or exempt procedures. A vote of \nthe members shall be taken concerning the request and the majority shall \ndecide the issue.  \n  33 C. Full Board Review  \n \nAll research which does not qualify for either exempt or expedited review or is deemed appropriate for a full -board review by the IRB shall be reviewed by the Full Board.  \nThis type of review is carried out for studies that pose greater than minimal risk to subjects. All protocols requiring IRB initial review and continuing review by the Full Board shall be reviewed at convened meetings and at timely intervals.  \n1. Meeting overview :  \nI. Each IRB normally meets  approximately  monthly during the fiscal year when \nthere are protocols to review. If there are no submissions, then the Chair \nmay cancel a meeting.  If an emergency meeting is necessary in order that the IRB's action conform to any aspect of DHHS and FDA regulations and/or institutional policies, such a meeting will be called by the IRB Chair.  \nII. In some cases, the principal investigator and co- investigators are formally \ninvited and may be required to attend the meeting at which their protocol is considered.  In such cases, if a representative of the review team knowledgeable about the study design  is not present, the IRB reserves the \nright to schedule a meeting time convenient for both the IRB and research \nteam  \nIII. The Institutional Official, IRB Manager , and IRB staff attend Full Board IRB \nmeetings to provide support. Other individuals who support ing the IRB  are \nwelcome to attend IRB meetings. In addition, any member of the ASU community may request permission of the appropriate IRB Chair to attend a meeting as a guest. All  guests must sign a confidentiality statement.  \n \na. Quorum and Meeting  \n \nA quorum of the IRB is defined as a majority of the total membership, \nand in order for official Board business to be conducted, a majority must be present. When it is determined that consultants or experts will be required to advise the IRB in its review of a protocol, the research protocol shall also be distributed to the consultants or experts prior to the meeting.  \nAt least one IRB member whose concerns are primarily in non- scientific \nareas must be present at the convened meeting before the IRB can conduct its review  of research. If quorum is lost during a meeting, the IRB \ndoes not take votes until quorum is restored.  \n Assigned Reviewers  \n \nFor each item to be considered by a fully convened IRB meeting, assigned reviewers are selected from the regular or alternate members of that specific IRB. Assigned reviewers  may be designated as primary reviewers \nor additional reviewers. The primary reviewer conducts a comprehensive \nreview of all submitted materials for the assigned item, presents findings resulting from that review, provides an assessment of the criteria for approval, and recommends specific actions to the IRB. The primary  34 reviewer leads the discussion of the assigned item. One or more \nadditional reviewers is assigned to new applications and to selected \ncontinuing reviews and modifications. Additional reviewers also conduct comprehensive reviews to supplement those provided by the primary reviewer, focusing on areas or issues not otherwise addressed. The additional reviewer may serve as the discussion leader in the unexpected absence of the primary reviewer.  \n All assigned reviewers are authorized to contact investigators or other study personnel (if appropriate) to resolve questions or concerns whenever possible prior to the convened IRB meeting or they may ask the \nIRB staff to obtain additional information directly for them. Checklists and/or Reviewer Worksheets are available to assist in organizing and documenting reviews for presentation at the fully convened meeting.  \n \nb. Voting  \n \nFor a research protocol to be approved, it must receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the convened meeting. The IRB follows Roberts Rules of Order.  \n No member of an IRB shall be involved in either the initial or continuing review of an activity in which he or she has a professional responsibility, except to provide information requested by the IRB and may not vote on any activity in which he or she has a conflicting interest.  The IRB members are briefed on what constitutes a conflict of interest. The IRB operates under HRP -001 and HRP -050 and in accordance with university \npolicies RSP 206: Objectivity in Research, \nACD 204 -08, Conflict of \ninterest  and ABOR 3 -901 Conflict of Interest .  In cases that research \nactivities were initially approved under expedited procedures and \nsubsequently reviewed by non- expedited procedures, the decisions \nreached at the convened meeting may supersede any decisions made through the expedited review.  \n As part of its deliberation, the IRB assesses whether the study is appropriately categorized as more than minimal risk, thereby requiring review by the convened IRB. This is done for new submissions as well as the continuations of protocols. In some cases, the IRB may vote to defer review to expedited review if the research falls under a category of \nresearch eligible for expedited review under 45 CFR 46.110.  This decision \nmust receive approval by a majority of the members.   \ni. If the IRB has approved the study, then researchers may begin the study, but only upon receiving a written approval letter from ORIA on behalf of the IRB.  \n  35 ii. The expiration date of the study usually will be 364 days from the date of \nthe convened meeting; in certain conditions, particularly in research \nthat includes th e possibility of risk to participants, the IRB may approve \na study for less than 364 days.   \n \niii. If the protocol submission is a modification, there is no change to the expiration date of the protocol (usually 364 days from the original approval date).  \n \niv. Modifications required to secure approval is when: the IRB approves a protocol with specific conditions that must be met by the PI before proceeding with the protocol. As part of its vote and deliberation, the IRB determines whether the modifications are c onsidered minor or \nsubstantial . If the modifications are minor, the IRB Chair or primary \nreviewer may be assigned to review the required revisions to determine if the conditions were satisfactorily met.  Modifications may be considered minor only if they w ill not change the risk to the \nparticipant regardless of the response. An IRB Coordinator will send the list of required revisions to the PI and Co- Investigators within 1 \nweek of the IRB meeting. The PI or one of the co- Investigators must \nsubmit the changes back to ORIA who will coordinate the review of the changes. The anniversary date for protocols approved with minor required revisions is generally 364 days from the date of the fully convened IRB meeting.  \n \nv. When the required revisions are substantial: this is defined as a study that does not meet criteria for approval as defined by 45  CFR 46.111; \nthe IRB requires that the modifications be reviewed by the convened IRB. As part of its deliberation, the IRB will determine whether any revisions to the IRB application, informed consent document or other documents will require review by the convened IRB and if the risk -\nbenefit ratio can be assessed. The IRB will also determine whether there are contingencies or modifications regarding the protocol or informed co nsent documents that are required for the IRB to make a \ndetermination under 45CFR46.111. When the IRB needs additional information to review the protocol in accordance with 45CFR46.111, approval must be deferred, pending subsequent review by the fully conv ened IRB.  \n Disapproved; is defined as the IRB does not approve of the project. The concerns  are of such significance that the IRB feels approval of the study to be \nunwarranted. An investigator has the right to appeal the disapproval of the research study to the IRB and to have the decision reconsidered.  The appeals \nmust be submitted in writing to the ORIA to the attention of the IRB Chair.  Investigators may resubmit a revised study to be considered as a new application requiring review by the convened IR B.  36  \nc. Minutes  \n \nIRB staff is responsible for recording and drafting the minutes of the IRB meeting.  The minutes or recordings must include at least the following information: date, time of meeting, members of the IRB present or excused,  any applicable confli cts of \ninterest,  an accurate description of all actions proposed, identification of the \napplicable regulatory subcategory of the regulations (e.g. 45 CFR 46 Part B for \nPregnant Women, Fetuses and Neonates involved in research) discussed or taken. The minut es also shall include applications discussed, the name of the primary \nreviewer, the action taken with respect to the statements and material presented, and a document listing Expedited and Exempt Reviews by the Chair or member of the IRB since the previous  minutes, and other business submitted to the IRB at the \nfully convened meeting.   All minutes will be stored and are available for a period of at least three years.  \n \nMinutes of IRB meetings shall be in sufficient detail to show the names of attendees at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; a written summary of the discussion of issues and their resol ution; and dissenting reports and opinions.   \n d. Notification  \n Staff members in the ORIA are responsible for notifying the research investigators in \nwriting of the IRB's decisions, conditions,  and requirements regarding research \nprotocols. If a study is disapproved, an investigator may submit a new application to be considered independently.  The research team may be invited to meet with an \nORIA staff member, and/or the IRB Chair for assistance in developing a new application prior to resubmitting the study.  \n \nWhen there is harm to subjects or if a project is not conduct ed in accordance with \nthe Board's requirements and/or conditions, the IRB has the authority to terminate or suspend its approval of the research. Investigators are notified of the IRB requirements particularly of suspensions or terminations in writing.  \n \nWhen a study is approved, the decision is emailed to the research team. The PI and \nresearch team receive an electronic copy of the approval letter and stamped consent forms.  \n \ne. Recordkeeping  \n \nIRB records are stored by the ORIA . Records include:  \n \ni. IRB submissi on documentation and approvals . \n  37 ii. Minutes of IRB meetings  \niii. Records of continuing review activities  \niv. Written procedures for the IRB.  \n \nThese records shall be retained for at least 3 years, and records relating to research \nwhich is conducted shall be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of the applicable regulatory agency at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.  \n 2. Submission Requirements :  \nResearchers should complete either a Social Behavioral Application or a \nBioscience Application depending on the area of the research.  The Bioscience IRB reviews research involving invasive procedures (saliva, tissue, urine, or blood samples  etc.), exercise science, dietary manipulation, human physiology, \nand studies that evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a medical product or procedure. The Social Behavioral IRB reviews research in  behavioral or social \nscience examining topics such as b ehavior, non- medical issues, opinions, \npersonal and social history, and educational practice.  Protocol applications must be submitted with complete responses to each section of the Application (including “Not Applicable,” when appropriate) and, together with required supplemental documents  (i.e. copies of questionnaires, consent and recruitment \nmaterials, sponsored proposal and external IRB authorizations) . The IRB \nsubmission must contain all the information necessary for reviewers to make \ninformed judgments about the impact of the research on participants. In some cases, letters of permission may be required when research is conducted at an off-campus  location.  Submissions  are reviewed in the order in which they are \nreceived.  Meeting dates and deadlines for studies requiring full board review are posted to the IRB website: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects\n \n• Review criteria : In evaluating a research project, the following are ba sic \nconsiderat ions as outlined by 45 CFR 46.111: \no Risks to subjects are minimized:  \n By using procedures which are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk  \n Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being \nperformed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.  \no Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result  \no In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB consider s only those risks and \nbenefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research).  \no The IRB does not cons ider possible long- range effects of applying \nknowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of  38 the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall \nwithin the purview of its responsibility.  \no Benefits do not include any  compensation that subjects will be paid for \nparticipating.  \no Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB takes  into account the purposes of the research and the setting in \nwhich the research will be conducted and if the investigator is  \nparticularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.  \no Informed consent is  sought from each prospective subject or the \nsubject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by §46.116.  \no Informed consent is  appropriately documented, in accordance with, \nand to the extent required by §46.117.  \no When appropri ate, the research plan makes adequate provisions when  \nmonitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.  \no When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.  \n The IRB reviews the protocol in its entirety to assess risks and benefits to subjects. As part of the review process, the IRB assesses issues such as compensation. There is not a set policy on the amount that subjects can be compensated. The IRB considers compensat ion provided and costs to participants including for example:  \n• Is the amount or type of compensation reasonable? \n• Are there adequate provisions to avoid out of pocket expenses by participants or is there strong justification for allowing participants to pay?  \n• If compensation is provided to minors is it appropriate?  \n \nWhen appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provisions for monitoring the data \ncollected to ensure the safety of subjects. The IRB will require that there are appropriate \nprovisions for monitoring data collected to ensure the safety of participants or ensure that negative outcomes do not occur.   \n \nIf it is determined that the research requires data and safety monitoring, the investigator \nmust describe the provisions for monitoring the data to ensure the safety of subjects. \nWhen required or appropriate, the PI includes a Data Safety and Monitoring Plan \n(DSMP) with the IRB application.  \n  \nOversight and monitoring requirements would depend on the nature and complexi ty of \nthe study.  The IRB review includes a description of the required monitoring provisions to ensure participant safety.  \n   39 VIII. INFORMED  CONSENT  AND RECRUITMENT  \n \nA. Overview \n \nInformed Consent is defined as person's voluntary agreement, based upon adequate \nknowledge and understanding of relevant information, to participate in research or to \nundergo a diagnostic, therapeutic, or preventive procedure. In giving informed consent, subjects may not waive or appear to waive any of their legal rights, or release or appear to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution or agents thereof from liability for negligence [Federal Policy §116; 21 CFR 50.20 and 50.25] (IRB Guidebook , no date).  \n Investigators are responsible for ensuring that the subjects, or their representatives, are given sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and must have sufficient protections in place to avoid coercion or undue influence. The IRB is \nresponsible for evaluating the informed consent process. Researchers may not involve a human being as a participant in research unless an investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the participant or the participant’s legally authorized representative. Information given to potential subjects or their representatives must be in a language that is understandable to the subject or representative. No process of obtaining consent may include exculpatory language through which subjects waive any of their legal rights or releases or appear to release the investigator, sponsor, or institution or its agents from liability for negligence. The consent process must provide sufficient information and an opportunity to consider whether to participate.  \n \nB. Elements of Informed Consent  \n A current sample of informed consent documents with boilerplate language may be found on the IRB web page at: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects . The \nsample consent forms contain all the required consent elements. In seeking informed consent,  the following information shall be provided to each subject.  The following are \nthe basic required elements (extracted from 45 CFR Part 46.116):  \n \n1. A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purposes of the research and expected dur ation of the subject's participation, a description of \nthe procedures to be followed, and identification of any procedures which are experimental  \n 2. A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject  \n 3. A description of any benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research \n 4. A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject  \n  40 5. A statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records \nidentifying the subject will be maintained  \n \n6. For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as to whether there is any compensation and whether any medical treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be obtained  \n 7. An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research- related injury to the subject and , \n 8. A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled and the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or los s of \nbenefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  \n 9. One of the following statements about any research that involves the collection of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens:  \n(i) A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private \ninformation or identifiable biospecimens and that, after such removal, the \ninformation or biospecimens could be used for future research studies or \ndistributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional \ninformed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative, if this \nmight be a possibility; or  \n(ii) A statement that the subject's information or biospecimens collected as part of \nthe research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for \nfuture research studies.  \n \nC. Additional elements of informed consent  \n When appropriate, one or more of the following elements of informed consent shall also be provided to each subject:  \n \n1. A statement that a particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the \nsubject (or the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) which are currently unforeseeable  \n 2. Anticipated circumstances under which the subject's participation may be \nterminated by the investigator without regard to the subject's consent  \n 3. Any additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the \nresearch   41  \n4. The consequences to the subject’s health or wellbeing of a subject's decision to \nwithdraw from the research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject  \n 5. A statement that significant new findings developed during the source of the \nresearch which may relate to the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject and  \n 6. The approximate number of subjects involved in the study.  \n \nD. Documentation of Consent  \n Federal regulations governing the use of human subjects in research activities and University Policy require written documentation of informed consent unless the research meets the criteria for Waiver of Documentation of Consent. This can be accomplished as part of the total consent process by using a consent form that has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.  The PI will receive a copy of the stamped consent for m that \nindicates the approval and expiration date for the study; the PI will use copies of this stamped consent form when consenting subjects. The following are the acceptable methods for documentation of informed consent of human research subjects at Ariz ona \nState University.  \n \n1. Research investigators are responsible for obtaining informed consent in accordance with 45CFR 46.116 and 21  CFR 50, and for ensuring that no human \nsubject will be involved in the research prior to the obtaining of the consent.  \n 2. Unless otherwise authorized by the IRB, research investigators are responsible \nfor ensuring that legally effective informed consent shall be:  \n a. Obtained in writing from the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative  \n b. In language understandable to the subject or the representative  \n c. Obtained under circumstances that offer the subject or the r epresentative \nsufficient opportunity to consider whether the subject should or should not \nparticipate, and \n d. does  not include exculpatory language through which the subject or the \nrepresentative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the research investigator, the sponsor, the institution or its agents from liability for negligence.  \n 3. Research investigators are responsible for ensuring that informed consent is documented by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB and  42 signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, unless \nthis requirement is spec ifically waived by the IRB.  \n 4. Research investigators shall ensure that each person signi ng the written consent \nform is offered a copy of that form.  \n 5. Research investigators are responsible for retaining the consent documents signed by human subjects in a repository approved by the IRB. In accor dance \nwith federal regulations , consent documents must be maintained for three years \nafter completion of the study.  \n 6. Faculty members assume responsibility for compliance with IRB policies and \nprocedures in all research conducted by students under their supervision. As \nsuch , the supervising f aculty member's name and contact information must be \nincluded  on the informed consent forms used by students so that subjects may \nbe able to contact  them with questions about the study.  \n 7. When minors (persons under 18) are involved in research, informed consent \nmust include adequate provisions for written assent of t he minor (when able, with \nappropriate language, usually 7 years or older), or oral assent by younger \nchildren, and permission of the parents or guardians. Parental or guardian permission may be waived by the IRB provided that an appropriate mechanism \nfor the protection of the minor is substituted or conditions  justifying modification \nof the waiver exist. This must be determined on an individual protocol basis.  \n 8. Researchers are expected to modify the language used on assent or scripts  to \nmatch the abilities of individuals not competent to give legally valid informed consent (e.g., children and individuals who are cognitively impaired). In research with such individuals, assent of the subject is required in addition to the written informed consent of the subject's legal guardian before data collection may begin.  \n 9. Short Form Consent  \n \nShort Form Consent forms  may be used for some categories of exempt research \nwith adults that involves data collection using surveys,  interview s and/or  focus \ngroups . The form should state the purpose of the study, a description of the topic \nof the research and the content of the questions on the survey or interview, a statement about confidentiality or anonymity, and a statement about how the participant may obtain additional information about the study. He or she need not sign it, because responding to the survey or interview indicates a willingness to \nparticipate in the study . In a study where a participant is taking part in a single \nsurvey or interview, and identifyi ng information is not being collected with study \nresponses, collection of written consent is not required. In a study involving a \nfocus group or another group activity where confidentiality cannot be guaranteed by the research team, documentation of written consent is required.   43  \n10. Prospective participants must be advised at the outset  (such as at the time they \nare filling out the informed consent forms)  as to the availability or non- availability \nof medical treatment or monetary compensation for physical injur ies incurred as \na result of participating in research, especially where behavioral or biomedical research presents risk of physical injury.  \n 11.  Audio/video recording  \n \nParticipants and subjects must be advised in the Informed Consent Form or in the cover let ter or information letter if their participation includes the use of \naudio/video recording. For more than minimal risk studies, subjects should be advised of the current and planned use of the recorded materials including \nstorage and access by persons other than the researcher and of any steps that will be taken, if any, to prevent participants from being recognized by others not on the research team who might be exposed during recordings . \n \nIn studies which do not include written informed consent (i.e., taped interviews in person or over the telephone); the elements of informed consent must be \nincluded as a preamble to the taped procedure.  In such cases, the PI must make \nprovisions for documenting that informed consent was obtained through methods such as th e signature of a witness other than the interviewer, recording of the \ninterviewee’s oral response, or other method acceptable to the IRB.  \n \nThe researcher must make proper arrangements for secure storage of all audio \nand video tapes /recordings . Plans may include storage, erasing, or destroying \nafter a given time period  per ASU/sponsor required retention policies . \n \n12. If the consent form (or information letter or cover letter) requires translation into a language other than English, the researchers  should submit a copy of the form in \nthat language as well as in English (even if no participant will see a copy in English). Any other forms that will be given to subjects should be submitted in English as well as any other languages in which they will be administered. \nResearchers should also submit a signed attestation certifying that someone has done the back translation by using the Translation and Back -Translation \nCertification Form which can be downloaded from the forms section of the IRB website:  https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects . The translation can \nbe done by any individual the principal investigator chooses; however, the back -\ntranslation should be done by someone different than the original translator.   The \nIRB recommends that the translation material not be submitted until the IRB has \napproved the English version of materials.  \n \n13. Recruitment Materials  \n \nThe IRB reviews any recruitment materials that will be provided to participants. All advertisements should be limited to providing i nformation that prospective  44 participants need to determine their eligibility and interest in participating in the \nstudy. \n \nE.  Waiver of Requirement of General Requirements for Informed Consent  \n \nThe provisions for waiver of informed consent do not apply to FDA regulated research involving human subjects.  \nThe IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, or which alters, \nsome or all of the elements of informed consent set forth above, or waive the requirement to obtain informed consent provided the IRB finds and documents that:  \n The research or demonstration project is to be conducted by  or subject to the \napproval of state or local government officials and is designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:  \n \n1. Public benefit of service programs ; \n 2. Procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs;  \n 3. Possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or  \n 4. Possible changes in methods or levels of payment  for benefits or services under  \n those programs; and  \n 5. The research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration.  \n An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in this section, or waive the requirements  to obtain informed consent provided the IRB finds and documents that:  \n \n1. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects  \n 2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the \nsubjects  \n 3. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration \nand \n 4. Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent \ninformation after participation (e.g., in the case of research involving deception).  \n  \nWaiver or alteration of consent procedures does not reduce researchers’ responsibility to follow all elements of the consent process approved by the IRB \nincluding being sure that participants understand the process.  \n \n  45 IX. SPECIAL POPULATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS  \n \nA. Vulnerable populations  \nThere are special procedures in place in the Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46 that \nprovide additional safeguards for the protection of vulnerable populations. These \ngroups include pregnant women, neonates, fetuses, prisoners and children. The \nASU IRB will adhere to 45 CFR Part 46 Subpart B, C, and D (https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations -and-policy/regulations/45-cfr- 46/index.html ).  \n 1. Pregnant Women, Neonates, and Fetuses  \nThe IRB reviews all guidelines as set forth in Subpart B of 45 CFR 46 and \napproves only those studies it has determined to fulfill all necessary regulatory requirements. Investigators should describe the rationale and details for the inclusion of pregnant women, fetuses, or neonates in the research. Researchers should ensure that the informed consent form adequately addresses the risk(s) to the fetus or neonate and pregnant women. The IRB ensures that there is adequate scientific and scholarly expertise to review the research and reserves the right to request expert consultation as necessary.  \n 2. Prisoners  \nThe IRB will adhere to Subpart C of 45  CFR 46. As such, the IRB will apply the \nprisoner specific definition of minimal risk as stated in 45 CFR 46.303(d)  and will \nfollow the requirements for IRB membership outlined in 45 CFR 46.107. \nInvestigators using prisoners as human subjects should provide specific detail and rationale in the IRB  application. Investigators are also required to take extra \nmeasures to ensure appropriate informed consent, since prisoners may be influenced by their incarceration to participate in research. If at some point a participant in a study becomes incarcerated, it is the responsibility of the PI to notify the IRB  and to postpone the participation of that individual in the research \nuntil approval has been received from the IRB. The protocol will then be re-\nreviewed according to Subpart C . Subpart C of 45 CFR 46 provides four research \ncategories that IRB may approve for prisoner research per §46.306 . The IRB will \nreview the proposed research to ensure one of the four categories is  applicable.  \n 3.  Children  \nThe exemptions listed in 45  CFR 46.104(d ) (1) through b (6) apply to research \ninvolving children except for 45 CFR 46.10 4(d) (2) for research involving surveys, \ninterview procedures, or observations of public behavior. Activities listed under 45  \nCFR 46.10 4(d)(2) do not apply to research covered by subpart D, except research \ninvolving observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Nonexempt studies involving children require parental or guardian consent and participant assent unless this can be waived under the Federal Regulations. As part of the review by the convened IRB the \ncommittee reviews whether the protocol is permissible under Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46 and 21CFR  50 where applicable. The IRB website contains a section \nspecific to research with children.   46  \nB. Classroom Research Assignments  \n \nClassroom or fieldwork projects that involve systematic collection of data and for which the objective or design is to develop or contribute to generalized knowledge are \nconsidered research. If a student plans to use the data outside of the classroom or fieldwork placement,  then the project is considered research. Such projects should be \nreviewed by the IRB.  \nClassroom or internship projects  that are designed with the objective  of providing \nstudents with  training about  and experience with research methods  are not considered \nresearch. In these cases, students will not use the data outside of the classroom or fieldwork placement.  Such projects do not require IRB review or oversight. In general, \nprojects conducted as part of fieldwork placements are not considered human subjects research.  Applied projects for which the data will not be published or presented outside of the classroom do not constitute human subjects research and as such do not require review by the IRB. If the project will be bound in a library  or submitted for publication, \nthen this requires IRB review.  \nC. Guidance Documents  \nFor more information about whether a classroom research project requires IRB approval, researchers may review the Guidance Document on Student Research Projects : https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects .   \nhttps://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects/regulations -and-resources\n \n Responsibility of Course Instructors  \n \n1. Make the decision about whether student research activities involving human \nparticipants meet eligibility for exclusion from IRB review  \n \n2. Oversee these activities  \n \n3. Ensure that ethical principles are adhered to in the conduct of those activities. \nSpecifically all participants must be invited to voluntarily participate and receive \nan explanation of what the activity is about and understand that their participation \nis voluntary, and the Principles of the Belmont Report regarding Respect for \nPersons, Beneficence and Justice should be adhered to when conducting the \nactivity.  \nD. T hes is and  Dissertations  \nResearch for undergraduate honor’s thes is, master's thes is, dissertations, and most \nindependent research studies must be reviewed by the IRB  if the work constitutes \nhuman subjects research. The same guidelines apply that apply to classroom research.   \n \nE. Subject Pools   47 Subject pools are undergraduate students enrolled in particular departmental courses \nrequiring participation in one or more research projects  or alternative opportunities for \nlearning about the research process . The IRB provides guidance and oversight of \ndepartmental subject pools and reviews all research requesting subject pool participation by reviewing individual protocols. All student participation in subject pool research must be completely voluntary. Departments may provide students with incentives (usually extra credit) to participate in the subject pool. Reimbursement for participation must not jeopardize the rights of t he participants. Any subject pools offering \nextra credit to participating students must provide alternative opportunities to earn extra credit to students declining to participate in research. There can be no penalties to participants in the studies  or tho se who choose not to participate. All steps of the \nresearch process must be voluntary. It is up to the student to decide whether to \nparticipate in any study; instructors cannot mandate or require student participation. Instructors are strongly discouraged from recruiting subjects they directly supervise or selecting subjects on such basis. Subject pool requirements and procedures vary by department,  so it is best for researchers to consult with their individual departments for \nspecific guidelines and additional requirements.  \n When experiments include minors, then the investigator must  obtain parental \npermission and child assent prior to the minor’s involvement in the research project. Instructors cannot mandate or require student participation.  \n If participa tion as a subject is part of the academic work of a subject, informed consent \nprocedures must be sufficiently sensitive not to be coercive and clearly not be made a mandatory requirement of the course. Students not wishing to participate should be given a choice of a reasonable alternate academic activity. The IRB has additional \nguidance on research with subject pools:  https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human-\nsubjects  \n \nF. Scopes of Work or Department Level Procedures  \nIn some cases, the IRB will review the scope of work or relevant set of guidelines for a particular department. For example, the Department of Exercise and Wellness has Sub maximal  and Maximal Exercise Participation and Testing Guidelines that are applied to \nresearch projects in that discipline.  \n \nG. N ative Americans  \nAll studies recruiting subjects who live on tribal land or that take place on tribal land are \nreviewed by a university advocate for Native Americans as part of the review process. ORIA facilitate s the review.  Researchers must document Tribal Counsel or other \nappropriate tribal approval as part of the application process. Research with Native American participants is reviewed using the categories of 45CFR46 and in accordance \nwith ABOR 118  available on the ORIA webpage. \nhttps://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects/regulations -and-resources . \n \nH. Oral History   48 The ASU IRB reviews oral history projects in a manner that is consistent with Federal \nRegulations at 45  CFR 46. Oral history projects conducted by ASU faculty, staff , and \nstudents are not required to be submitted for review by the IRB unless they constitute human subjects research.  Oral history interviews that document experiences of individuals or document specific events do not constitute human subjects research as  \nthey would not lead to the development of a hypothesis or generali zed knowledge. If \noral history activities are conducted in such a way that there is a systematic investigation that is likely to lead to generalized knowledge, then t his is human subject’s  \nresearch.  \n \nI. Other Population Groups  \nResearch involving populations such as the mentally or physically infirm  or with \ndiminished  cognitive  capacity , and others in conditions of dependency, helplessness, or \ndeprivation, may require additional precautions and procedures to assure their protection.  Subjects may be paid to encourage their participation. Where subjects are drawn from particularly vulnerable groups, however, compensation under certain circumstances may cast doubt upon the voluntary nature of their  consent. In such \ncircumstances the IRB may either limit or disapprove compensation.  \nAn individual’s capacity to provide informed consent to research can be affected by such conditions as mental disorders, neurological disorders, metabolic impairments, or head trauma, or by psychoactive medications and substance abuse. Consent capacity  \ncan also be affected by poverty or deficits in education, or transient situations where an individual is in emotional or physical crisis . \n The IRB is responsible for evaluating the role of a legally  authorized representative \nwhen participants have impaired consent capacity and for ensuring adequate \nprotections to ensure voluntary participation and comprehensi on by the participant of \ninformed consent.  \n \nThe ASU IRB drafts guidance documents to supplement policies that pertain to special issues and populations. Guidance documents can be found at: https://researchintegrity.asu.edu/human- subjects . The topics covered include those \nsuch as stem cell research, recruitment using subject pools, and classroom research. New guidance documents will be developed and posted based on requests from researchers, the Institutional Official, and IRB members.  \n \nJ. Clinical Trials  \nPrincipal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for making the determination if their study meets the definition  of a clinical trial.  Information is posted at:  \nhttps://grants.nih.gov/ct- decision/index.htm\n which  outlines requirements for registration \nof the trial. The ASU IRB will review the study to see if it should be reviewed by the ASU IRB or if review by an external IRB is required.  This is done on a study by study basis.   \nIf a researcher determines that their study meets the definition of a clinical trial, all the study team members engaged in the clinical trial must complete Good Clinical Practices (GCP) training through CITI program ( www.citiprogram.org\n). The IRB may consider \nother training options on a case- by-case basis.    49 X. FDA- regulated research  \n \nResearch involving drugs , devices , biologics or products  regulated primarily by the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA).   The FDA requires IRB review in cases in which the study \ninvolves human s ubjects  and involves products regulated by the  FDA. Clinical trials \nconducted under an IND (Investigational New Drug) or IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) issued by the FDA must adhere to the protocol submitted to the FDA.   Subject \nsafety protocol deviations must be reported to the IRB.  The Principal Investigator must \nmaintain study records, consent documents and all study correspondence. The records must also relate to the control of investigational study drugs and devices and need to include receipt and disposition (used, returned and/or destroyed).  \nA. Research involving devices  \nThe FDA and the IRB have the responsibility for assuring subject safety and effectiveness of devices intended for human use.   The FDA has classified \ninvestigational devices as either Significant Risk Devices or as Non- Significant Risk \nDevices.  \n1. Non-Significant Risk (NSR)  \nA non -significant risk device is one that does not present a significant risk to the \nresearch subject, taking into account all of the  risks inherent in the \nstudy.  Following the determination of the risk factor, the IRB will review the \nprotocol to make a risk/benefit assessment and review the consent document for appropriateness.  \n2. Significant Risk (SR)  \nThe Sponsor is responsible for making the initial assessment regarding whether an investigational device is a significant risk.   A significant risk device is an \ninvestigational medical device that presents a serious risk to the health and safety of the subject.  The device is:  \na. Intended for use as an implant; or  \n b. Purported to be useful in supporting or sustaining human life; or  \n c. Intended for a use that is of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, \nmitigating or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health; or  \n d. One that otherwise prevents a serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of \nsubjects  \n \nThe IRB will make an independent assessment of the risk of the device to be used for the study.  After risk determination, the IRB will make a risk/benefit assessment and \ndetermine the appropriateness of the consent document as part of the review process. The IRB will review whether the device is considered to be non- significant and will consult  50 the investigator and/or sponsor when appropriate. The IRB also has an internal checklist \nfor review of devices.   \n \nB. Research involving medical devices  \n Research involving medical devices shall be conducted in accordance with regulations 21CFR812. For more information, refer to the following website: \nhttp://ww w.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=81\n2  \n \nC. Research involving Investigational Drugs -Review 21 CFR 56  \n \n1. An investigational drug may be defined by one of the following:  \n \na. A drug in any of the clinical stages of evaluation (Phase I, II, III) which has not \nbeen released by the FDA for general use or cleared for sale in interstate commerce.  \n b. Any commercially available drug proposed for a new use.  \n c. Any commercially available drug to be used in a new dosage form or method of administration.  \n d. Any commercially available drug which contains a new component such as an excipient, coating or menstruum.  \n e. A new combination of two or more commercially available drugs.  \n f. A combination of commercially available drugs in new proportions.  \n g. Any commercially available drug involved in a post -marketing surveillance.  \n \n2. The investigational use of an approved, marketed product suggests the use of an approved product in the context of a study protocol. When the principal int ent of \nthe investigational use of the drug is to develop information about its safety or effica cy, IRB review and approval is required.  \n 3. As provided by 21 CFR 312.34, during the clinical investigation of a drug, it may be appropriate to use the drug in the treatment of patients not in the clinical trials, in accordance with a Treatment Investigational New Drug (IND). The purpose of a Treatment IND is to facilitate the availability of promising new drugs to desperately ill patients as early in the drug development process as possible. \nFDA shall permit  an investigational drug to be used for a treatment use under a \nTreatment IND if:  \n  51 a. The drug is intended to treat a serious or immediately life- threatening \ndisease;  \n \nb. There is no comparable or satisfactory alternative drug or other therapy available to treat that stage of the disease in the intended patient population.  \n c. The drug is under investigation in a controlled clinical trial under an IND in effect for the trial, or all clini cal trials have been completed; and  \n d. The sponsor of the controlled clinical trial is actively pursuing marketing approval of the investigational drug with due diligence.  \n \n4. Charging for an investigational drug in a clinical trial under an IND is not permitted without the prior approval of the FDA. A sponsor or investigator may, however, charge for an investigational drug under a Treatment IND providing the criteria specified under 312.7 are met.  \n \nTo determine whether an investigational new drug application or  investigational \ndevice exemption (IND or IDE) is required for a study of a drug or device, the IRB, Office of Research Integrity and Assurance or researcher may contact the Document Management and Reporting Branch, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), for a biological product, the Division of Biological Investigational New Drugs Office of Biological Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and for a medical device, the Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and  Radiological Health (CDRH). Researchers should contact the Office of \nResearch Integrity and Assurance (480) 965- 6788 for assistance in contacting any \nof the offices referenced above.  \n    52 XI. GENETICS RESEARCH AND BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS  \n \nA. Genetics Research  \nRisks to the subjects of genetic research may include potential psychological and social harms, such as anxiety, damage to familial relationships, or discrimination. These risks may further extend to members of the participant's family who did not  have the \nopportunity for prior informed consent. An understanding of the actual risks posed by a given research project is critical to the ASU IRB's decision whether (a) the protocol must be reviewed by the Full Board or can be reviewed by the Expedited Review, (b) the proposed consent is adequate, and (c) whether the scientific and/or clinical benefits outweigh the risks. The principal investigator must give careful consideration to the possible risks to the participants and include a full discussion of those risks in the submission to the ASU IRB.  \n \nB. Biological Materials           \n  IRB approval must be obtained when research activities include the use of data from records or stored specimens (blood, urine, tissue, and other human products). Researchers should refer to OHRP Guidance on Research Involving Coded Private \nInformation or Biological Specimens:  http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/cdebiol.html\n  to \ndetermine if these provisions apply and questions can be referred to ORIA staff.  \n Basic information such as age, gender, date, what the specimen is and diagnosis may be retained with the specimen. The specimen may be shared with researchers from other institutions and or sent elsewhere for analysis. The specimen may be stored indefinitely.  Information about the future use and retention must be explained to subjects.  The consent form must clearly state that the specimen was donated for research purposes. The consent form should indicate if the specimen may be used for research purposes  that has not yet been determined. If the biological material will be used for \nfuture genetic research any details available must be fully explained. The consent form \nshould include information related to future use of data including a description of any genetic analyses. Additional information on the requirement for Broad consent is available on the  OHRP website\n \n    53 XII. REPORTABLE NEW INFORMATION, ADVERSE EVENTS AND \nUNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS INVOLVING RISKS TO SUBJECTS AND OTHERS  \n \n \nA. Definitions  \n \n1. Adverse Events  \nAn adverse event is any injury, trauma, or illness experienced by a subject that \nrequired medical or psychological treatment. Only a subset of adverse events will need to be reported to the IRB. The IRB requires the reporting of adverse events that may repres ent unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or \nothers. Any risks that were listed in the consent form do not constitute adverse events and do not have to be reported to the IRB.  \n 2. ASU uses the definitions provided in the OHRP Guidance Document “Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Events”. Researchers are urged to consult this document:  \nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations -and-policy/guidance/reviewing-\nunanticipated- problems/index.html   \n \n \n3. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that  \n a. Results in death  \n b. Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the \nevent)  \n c. Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  \n d. Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  \n e. Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or  \n f. Based upon appropriate medical judgment,  may jeopardize t he subject’s \nhealth and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the \nother outcomes listed in this definition  \n \n4. An unexpected adverse event is any adverse event occurring in one or more \nsubjects participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of \nwhich is not  consistent with either:  \n \ni. The known or foreseeable risk of adverse events  associated with the \nprocedures involved in the research that are described in the protocol -related \ndocuments, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable  54 investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent \ndocument, and  \n \nii. Other relevant  sources of information, such as product labeling and package \ninserts; or  \n \niii. The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or \ncondition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  \n \nC. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  \n \na. The following are used to define unanticipated risks:  \n b. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research \nprocedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the \nIRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the \ncharacteristics of the subject population being studied  \n c. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in thi s guidance \ndocument, possibly related is defined as there is a reasonable possibility that \nthe incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research) and  \n d. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  \n  \nB. Reporting  \n \nThe PI must make the initial determination that the event is an unanticipated problem involving risks to others. Unanticipated Problems and unexpected adverse events experienced by research subjects must be reported to the IRB in a timely manner using the reportable new information tab in ERA IRB . The procedures vary based on the \nnature of the event, whether serious, unexpected, both or neither.   It is the responsibility \nof the ASU PI to make the initial determination of a relationship between an \nunanticipated problem   and unexpected adverse event (either internal or external) and any investigational agent(s), intervention, or research study procedure. An adverse event is \"related to the research\" if in the opinion of the principal investigator, it was more  likely than not related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention. If there is any \ndoubt, then the event needs to be reported to the IRB.  \n An adverse event that is serious must be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of the researcher becoming aware of it. Reporting through the ERA IRB Module  is preferred . \nAlternatives include email ( asuirb @asu.edu), or a phone call (480- 965-6788) to ORIA.  55 Information to be included is a description of the nature of the event, the medical \ntreatment that the subject received, the likelihood that the event was related to the \nresearch protocol, and any changes in the protocol or informed consent that the researcher feels may be needed to protect other subjects. A consulting physician must also comment on the severity of the event and the likelihood that it was related to the protocol.   \n \nAll other unexpected adverse events or unanticipated problem involving risk to the subject or others must be reported to the IRB within 5 business days of the researcher becoming aware of them, using the report new information button within ERA IRB . \nHowever, if the event is not serious, a consulting physician is not required.  Reporting of \nall adverse events (including any that may have been anticipated risks) is required as part of  the application material for continuing review.  \n If after a study is complete, researchers become aware of adverse or unanticipated events related to the study that were not initially disclosed in the consent form they should notify the IRB and participants when applicable. The continuing review/study closure form  should be updated to reflect this change.  \n Researchers should contact an IRB staff member in the ORIA at 480 -965-6788 with \nquestions regarding adverse events and the reporting process.  \n    56 XIII. CONTINUING REVIEW , CLOSE OUT, AND MODIFICATIONS  \n \nA. Approval Period  \n \nResearch that does not meet the criteria for exemption requires ongoing monitoring.  The interval for continuing review is made at the discretion of the IRB but shall occur as determined by the IRB based on an evaluation of the risks and benefits.    \n Following initial approval, the PI must seek review for  expedited and full board studies \nthat last longer than the approval period. Researchers should submit a continuing Review ( CR) to ERA IRB  if the project is to last longer than the approval period. \nAdditionally, the PI must ensure that progress reports are submitted more frequently when required by the IRB. If a non-exempt  study will last for longer than 5 years, then \nthe PI should close the study at the fifth year  and submit a new (renewal) application if \nthe study is open to enrollment or follow up of participants.  The IRB staff may determine \non a case- by-case basis that studies permanently closed to enrollment and follow -up \nmay remain active without submission of  a new application. \n  In addition to continuing review, PIs are still required to submit modifications for personnel changes and changes to other parts of the study  to get IRB approval before \nimplementing the changes . \n \nB. Reminder Notices  \n To assist investigators in meeting the deadlines for submitting requests for continuing review reminder notices are sent through ERA IRB .  The first remi nder is sent out \napproximately 90 days prior to the expiration date. A second reminder is sent approximately 60 days prior to the expiration date  and a third notice is sent \napproximately 30 days prior to the expiration date .  A termination notice is sent to the PI \nafter the expiration date.  ORIA staff will administratively close the study after expiration \ndate.  \n \nC. Application and Review Process  \n \nFor studies requiring a continuing review , the PI shall  submit  the CR through ERA IRB . \nThis should be submitted no later than approximately three weeks  prior to the expiration \ndate of the project approval. This allows the IRB to review the study well before it expires, thus avoiding a lapse in the research. Failure to seek annual review  and \napproval in time may  jeopardize the conduct of the study for the researcher.  \n If any changes to the protocol or the consent form are being requested at the time of this continuing review, researchers should provide an explanation of the requested changes and submit the new informed consent document/ revised forms in place of the previously approved documents.  \n  57 The continuing review is done in accordance with Federal regulations. If the study was \noriginally approved by the Full Board and the study is open to enrollment of new subjects, the study must be reviewed by the Fully convened Board which will continue \nto assess the risk and determine the appropriate level of review.  For continuing review \nof protocols reviewed by the fully convened I RB, the Primary Reviewer is responsible \nfor reviewing the complete protocol including modifications previously approved by the IRB including that that current consent document is still accurate and complete.  If the \nstudy was originally approved by the Full Board but the study activities are limited to data analysis or the study is closed to enrollment, then review can be done by expedited review in accordance with Federal Regulations. Protocols that were originally approved by expedited review and for which researchers propose to continue research longer than the original approval period can be reviewed by expedited review.    The continuing review form in IRB -ERA contains all required element for status \nreporting including:  \n1. Participants accrued  2. Wit hdraw als and reason for withdrawal  \n3. Adverse events and unanticipated problems involving risks  \n4. Complaints  \n5. Interim findings  6. Recent literature  \n7. Changes to the benefits and risks  \n8. Report of multi centered investigations  \n9. Current consent  document if study is active/open to participant enrollment  \n Continuing review applications approved before the expiration date will be issued a new approval date. Continuing review applications submitted prior to their expiration date but not formally reviewed and approved by the expiration date are considered \nexpired/lapsed  studies and all research related activities (including data analysis) must \ncease until formal IRB approval is provided.   \nFailure to submit continuing review materials on t ime will result in administrative closure \nof the study.  If this should happen researchers will be required to permanently close the study and submit a new application if they wish to continue the research. All research, \nincluding data analysis must cease when IRB approval expires.  \n The IRB has the authority to observe the conduct of research or to appoint an independent party to act on its behalf to monitor  the consent process.  The IRB may \nrequire verification of the study procedures during continuing review when materials submitted  for continuing review are inconsistent with those previously submitted, \ninconsistencies cannot be resolved by communications, or when it is determined that additional protections are necessary as part of a corrective action plan when unanticipated problem s or adverse events have occurred.  \n  58 When findings of observational investigations warrant corrective actions, the IRB may \nterminate or suspend the study.  An investigator may appeal the suspension by submitting a written request to ORIA  to the attention of  the IRB Chair.  \n \nD. Project Close Out  \n Researchers shall submit a continuation through ERA IRB  when the study is complete. \nA nonexempt study is considered complete when data collection and data analysis are done.  \n   \nE. Modifications  \n Researchers are required to submit modifications for review by the IRB for any changes \nto non- exempt studies. For questions on submitting a Modification for an exempt study, \ncontact  ORIA by emailing asuirb@asu.edu  \n \nThe criteria for approving modifications to previously approved research is  the same as \nfor any new protocol. Proposed revisions including those to recruitment and consent must meet the same requirements as those for initial approvals. Primary considerations include:  \n1. Risks to currently enrolled participants.  \n2. Risks to future participants.  \n3. If risks are increased, does the revision meet the criterial for \napproval?  \n              59 XIV.

Behavioral interventions are intended to prevent or \ntreat an acute or chronic disease or condition. Clinical trial research involves the \nevaluating effects of an intervention on biomedical or behavioral human health related  60 to outcomes. This definition is not intended to be inclusive of all clinical research \nactivities.  \nCOGNITIVELY IMPAIRED Having a psychiatric disorder (e.g., psychosis, personality or \nbehavior disorders, or dementia) or a developmental disorder (e.g., mental retardation)  \nthat affects cognitive or emotional functions to the extent that capacity for judgment and \nreasoning is significantly diminished. Others, including persons under the influence of or dependent on drugs or alcohol, those suffering from degenerative diseases  affecting the \nbrain, terminally ill patients, and persons with severely disabling physical handicaps, may also be compromised in their ability to make decisions in their best interests.  \nCOMPENSATION Payment or medical care provided to subjects injured in research; \ndoes not refer to payment (remuneration) for participation in research.

In the conduct of cooperative research\nprojects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare\nof human subjects and for complying with this policy.\n(b)(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative\nresearch must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research\nthat is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be identified by the\nFederal department or agency supporting or conducting the research or\nproposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal\ndepartment or agency supporting the research.\n    (2) The following research is not subject to this provision:\n        (i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by\nlaw (including tribal law passed by the o\u0000icial governing body of an American\nIndian or Alaska Native tribe); or\n        (ii) Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting or\nconducting the research determines and documents that the use of a single\nIRB is not appropriate for the particular context.\n(c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution\nparticipating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review\narrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangements\nfor avoiding duplication of e\u0000ort.\nThe compliance date of 45 CFR 46.114(b) of the 2018 Requirements was January\n20, 2020.

In determining whether children are capable of\nassenting, the IRB shall take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological\nstate of the children involved. This judgment may be made for all children to be\ninvolved in research under a particular protocol, or for each child, as the IRB\ndeems appropriate. If the IRB determines that the capability of some or all of the\nchildren is so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted or that the\nintervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of direct\nbenefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is\navailable only in the context of the research, the assent of the children is not a\nnecessary condition for proceeding with the research. Even where the IRB\ndetermines that the subjects are capable of assenting, the IRB may still waive the\nassent requirement under circumstances in which consent may be waived in\naccord with §46.116 </ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/regulatory-\ntext/index.html#46.116> of Subpart A </ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/regulatory-\ntext/index.html#subparta>.\n (b) In addition to the determinations required under other applicable sections of\nthis subpart, the IRB shall determine, in accordance with and to the extent that\nconsent is required by §46.116 </ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/regulatory-\ntext/index.html#46.116> of Subpart A </ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/regulatory-\ntext/index.html#subparta>, that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the\npermission of each child's parents or guardian. Where parental permission is to be\nobtained, the IRB may find that the permission of one parent is su\u0000icient for\nresearch to be conducted under §46.404 or §46.405. Where research is covered by\n§§46.406 and 46.407 and permission is to be obtained from parents, both parents\nmust give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent,\nor not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for\nthe care and custody of the child.\n (c) In addition to the provisions for waiver contained in §46.116 </ohrp/regulations-\nand-policy/regulations/regulatory-text/index.html#46.116> of subpart A </ohrp/regulations-and-\npolicy/regulations/regulatory-text/index.html#subparta>, if the IRB determines that a research\nprotocol is designed for conditions or for a subject population for which parental\nor guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects\n(for example, neglected or abused children), it may waive the consent10/4/24, 7:24 PM Subpart D — Additional Protections for Children Involved | HHS.gov\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/common-rule-subpart-d/index.html 6/8requirements in Subpart A </ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/regulatory-\ntext/index.html#subparta> of this part </ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/regulatory-\ntext/index.html#part46> and paragraph (b) of this section, provided an appropriate\nmechanism for protecting the children who will participate as subjects in the\nresearch is substituted, and provided further that the waiver is not inconsistent\nwith federal, state, or local law.

The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as\nappropriate, after consultation with other feder al department s and agencies and after publication in the FEDERAL  R EGISTER  for public\ncomment . A copy of the list is available from the O\u0000ce for Human Research Protections, HHS,  or any successor o\u0000ce.\n(b)\n(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:\n(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that\nthe study involves more than minimal risk;\n(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or\n(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemp tion under  § 46.104(d) (2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).\n(2) Under  an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers\ndesignated by the chairperson from among memb ers of the IRB.

In evaluating risks and bene\u0000 ts, the IRB should consider only those risks and bene\u0000 ts that may\nresult from the research (as distinguished from risks and bene\u0000 ts of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the\nresearch). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible\neffects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.\n(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment  the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the\nsetting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems  of research that\ninvolves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue in\u0000uence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with\nimpaired decision-ma king capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.\n(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance\nwith, and to the extent required by, § 46.116.\n(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documen ted or appropriately waived in accordance with § 46.117.\n(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.\n(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the con\u0000dent iality of data.\n(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the O\u0000ce of Management  and Budget's privacy o\u0000ce and other Feder al\ndepartment s and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are\nadequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the con\u0000dent iality of data.\n(ii) [Reserved]\n(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 46.104(d) (7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at\nparagraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:\n(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of ident i\u0000able private information or ident i\u0000able\nbiospecimens  is obtained in accordance with the requirement s of § 46.116(a )(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);\n(ii) Broad consent is appropriately document ed or waiver of document ation is appropriate, in accordance with § 46.117; and\n(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the ident i\u0000able private information or ident i\u0000able biospecimens  are\nstored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the con\u0000dent iality of\ndata.\n(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue in\u0000uence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with\nimpaired decision-ma king capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included\nin the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.\n(a) Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this policy that involve more than one institution. In the conduct of\ncooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for\ncomplying with this policy.\n(b)\n(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that\nportion of the research that is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be ident i\u0000ed by the Feder al department  or\nagency supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Feder al\ndepartment  or agency supporting the research.\n(2) The following research is not subject to this provision:10/4/24, 7:12 PM eCFR :: 45 CFR Part 46 (July 19, 2018) -- Protection of Human Subjects\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46 10/22§ 46.115 IRB records.\n(Approved by the O\u0000ce of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)\n§ 46.116 General requirements for informed consent.(i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by law (including tribal law passed by the o\u0000cial\ngoverning body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or\n(ii) Research for which any Feder al department  or agency supporting or conducting the research determines and document s that\nthe use of a single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context.\n(c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review\narrangement , rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangement s for avoiding duplication of effort.\n(a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and maintain adequate document ation of IRB activities, including the following:\n(1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scienti\u0000c evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample consent\nforms, progress reports submitted by investigators, and reports of injuries to subjects.\n(2) Minutes of IRB meet ings, which shall be in su\u0000cient detail to show attenda nce at the meet ings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on\nthese actions including the number of memb ers voting for, against, and abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or\ndisapproving research; and a written summa ry of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution.\n(3) Records of continuing review activities, including the rationale for conducting continuing review of research that otherwise would\nnot require continuing review as described in § 46.109(f )(1).\n(4) Copies of all correspondenc e between the IRB and the investigators.\n(5) A list of IRB memb ers in the same detail as described in § 46.108(a )(2).\n(6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described in § 46.108(a )(3) and (4).\n(7) Statement s of signi\u0000cant new \u0000ndings provided to subjects, as required by § 46.116(c )(5).\n(8) The rationale for an expedited reviewer's determination under  § 46.110(b )(1)(i) that research appearing on the expedited review list\ndescribed in § 46.110(a ) is more than minimal risk.\n(9) Document ation specifying the responsibilities that an institution and an organization operating an IRB each will under take to ensure\ncompliance with the requirement s of this policy, as described in § 46.103(e) .\n(b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at least 3 years, and records relating to research that is conducted shall be\nretained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. The institution or IRB may maintain the records in printed form, or\nelectronically. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of the Feder al department  or\nagency at reasonable times  and in a reasonable manner .\n(a) General. Gener al requirement s for informed consent, whether written or oral, are set forth in this paragraph and apply to consent obtained\nin accordance with the requirement s set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

The IRB shall approve a written\nsumma ry of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a\nwitness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized\nrepresentative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summa ry, and the person actually obtaining\nconsent shall sign a copy of the summa ry. A copy of the summa ry shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized\nrepresentative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n(c)\n(1) An IRB may waive the requirement  for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it \u0000nds\nany of the following:\n(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be\npotential harm resulting from a breach of con\u0000dentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked\nwhether the subject wants document ation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;\n(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written\nconsent is normally required outside of the research context; or\n(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are memb ers of a distinct cultural group or commu nity in which signing\nforms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an\nappropriate alternative mec hanism for document ing that informed consent was obtained.\n(2) In cases in which the document ation requirement  is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally\nauthorized representatives with a written stateme nt regarding the research.10/4/24, 7:12 PM eCFR :: 45 CFR Part 46 (July 19, 2018) -- Protection of Human Subjects\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46 14/22Except for research waived under  § 46.101(i ) or exemp ted under  § 46.104, in the event research is under taken without the intention of involving\nhuman subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human subjects in the research, the research shall \u0000rst be reviewed and approved by an IRB, as\nprovided in this policy, a certi\u0000cation submitted by the institution to the Feder al department  or agency component  supporting the research, and\n\u0000nal approval given to the proposed change by the Feder al department  or agency component .\n§ 46.120 Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal\ndepartment or agency.\n§ 46.121 [Reserved]\n§ 46.122 Use of Federal funds.\nFeder al funds administered by a Feder al department or agency may not be expended for research involving human subjects unless the\nrequirement s of this policy have been satis\u0000ed.\n§ 46.123 Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applications and proposals.\n§ 46.124 Conditions.\nWith respect to any research project or any class of research projects the department  or agency head of either the conducting or the supporting\nFeder al department  or agency may impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment  of the department  or\nagency head additional conditions are necessary for the protection of human subjects.\nSubpart B - Additional Protections for Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates Involved in Research\nSource:66 FR 56778 , Nov. 13, 2001,  unless otherwise noted.\n§ 46.201 To what do these regulations apply?\n§ 46.202 De\u0000initions.\nThe de\u0000nitions in § 46.102 shall be applicable to this subpart as well.

In determining whether children are capable of assenting, the IRB shall take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological\nstate of the children involved. This judgment  may be made for all children to be involved in research under  a particular protocol, or for\neach child, as the IRB deems  appropriate. If the IRB determines that the capability of some or all of the children is so limited that they\ncannot reasonably be consulted or that the intervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of direct bene\u0000 t that\nis important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the research, the assent of the children is not\na necessary condition for proceedi ng with the research. Even where the IRB determines that the subjects are capable of assenting, the\nIRB may still waive the assent requirement  under  circumstances in which consent may be waived in accord with § 46.116 of subpart A.\n(b) In addition to the determinations required under  other applicable sections of this subpart, the IRB shall determine, in accordance with and\nto the extent that consent is required by § 46.116 of subpart A, that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the permission of each\nchild's parents or guardian. Where parental permission is to be obtained, the IRB may \u0000nd that the permission of one parent is su\u0000cient\nfor research to be conducted under  § 46.404 or § 46.405. Where research is covered by §§ 46.406 and 46.407 and permission is to be\nobtained from parents, both parents must give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably\navailable, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.\n(c) In addition to the provisions for waiver contained in § 46.116 of subpart A, if the IRB determines that a research protocol is designed for\nconditions or for a subject population for which parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement  to protect the subjects\n(for example, neglected or abused children), it may waive the consent requirement s in subpart A of this part and paragraph (b) of this\nsection, provided an appropriate mec hanism for protecting the children who will participate as subjects in the research is substituted,\nand provided further that the waiver is not inconsistent with Feder al, state or local law. The choice of an appropriate mec hanism would\ndepend upon the nature and purpose of the activities described in the protocol, the risk and anticipated bene\u0000 t to the research subjects,\nand their age, maturity, status, and condition.\n(d) Permission by parents or guardians shall be document ed in accordance with and to the extent required by § 46.117 of subpart A.\n(e) When the IRB determines that assent is required, it shall also determine whether and how assent must be document ed.10/4/24, 7:12 PM eCFR :: 45 CFR Part 46 (July 19, 2018) -- Protection of Human Subjects\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46 20/22§ 46.409 Wards.\nSubpart E - Registration of Institutional Review Boards\nSource:74 FR 2405 , Jan. 15, 2009,  unless otherwise noted.\n§ 46.501 What IRBs must be registered?\nEach IRB that is designated by an institution under  an assurance of compliance approved for feder alwide use by the O\u0000ce for Human Research\nProtections (OHRP) under  § 46.103(a ) and that reviews research involving human subjects conducted or supported by the Department  of Health\nand Human Services (HHS)  must be registered with HHS.

L. 93 -348) was signed into law, there-by creating the \nNational Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. One of the \ncharges to the Commission was to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical \nand behavioral research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines which should be followed to assure that \nsuch research is conducted in accordance with those principles. In carrying out the above, the Commission was \ndirected to consider:  (i) the boundaries between biomedical and behavioral research and the accepted and routine \npractice of medicine,  (ii) the role of assessment of risk -benefit criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of \nresearch involving human subjects,  (iii) appropriate guidelines for the selection of human subjects for participation in \nsuch research  and (iv) the nature and definition of informed consent in various research settings.  \nThe Belmont Report attempts to summarize the basic ethical principles identified by the Commission in the course of \nits deliberations. It is the outgrowth of an intensive four-day period of discussions that were held in February 1976 at \nthe Smithsonian Institution's Belmont Conference Center supplemented by the monthly deliberations of the \nCommission that were held over a period of nearly four years. It is a statement of basic ethical principles and \nguidelines that should assist in resolving the ethical problems that surround the conduct of research with human \nsubjects. By publishing the Report in the Federal Register, and providing reprints upon request, the Secretary intends \nthat it may be made readily available to scientists, members of Institutional Review Boards, and Federal employees. \nThe two-volume Appendix, containing the lengthy reports of experts and specialists who assisted the Commission in \nfulfilling this part o f its charge, is available as DHEW Publication No. (OS) 78-0013 and No. (OS) 78 -0014, for sale by \nthe Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.  \nUnlike most other reports of the Commission, the Belmont Report does  not make specific recommendations for \nadministrative action by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Rather, the Commission recommended that \nthe Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety, as a statement of the Department's policy. The Department requests \npublic comment on this recommendation.  \n \n \n \n  \nNational Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of \nBiomedical and Behavioral Research \nMembers of the Commission  \nKenneth John Ryan, M.D., Chairman, Chief of Staff, Boston Hospital for Women.  \nJoseph V.

Assessment of Risk and Benefits  \n3. Selection of Subjects  \n \n  \nEthical Principles & Guidelines for Research Involving Human Subjects  \nScientific research has produced substantial social benefits. It has also posed some troubling ethical \nquestions. Public attention was drawn to these questions by reported abuses of human subjects in \nbiomedical experiments, especially during the Second World War. During the Nuremberg War Crime Trials, \nthe Nuremberg code was drafted as a set of standards for judging physicians and scientists who had \nconducted biomedical  experiments on concentration camp prisoners. This code became the prototype of \nmany later codes  [1] intended to assure that research involving human subjects would be carried out in an \nethical manner.  \nThe codes consist of rules, some general, others specific, that guide the investigators or the reviewers of \nresearch in their work. Such rules often are inadequate to cover complex situations; at times they come into \nconflict, and they are frequently difficult to interpret or apply. Broader ethical principles will provide a basis \non which specific rules may be formulated, criticized and interpreted.  \nThree principles, or general prescriptive judgments, that are relevant to research involving human subjects \nare identified in this statement. Other principles may also be relevant. These three are comprehensive, \nhowever, and are stated at a level of generalization that should assist scientists, subjects, reviewers and \ninterested citizens to understand the ethical issues inherent in research involving human subjects. These \nprinciples cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The \nobjective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from \nresearch involving human subjects.  \nThis statement consists of a distinction between research and practice, a discussion of the three basic \nethical principles, and remarks about the application of these principles.  \n \nPart A: Boundaries Between Practice & Research  \nA. Boundaries Between Practice and Research  \nIt is important to distinguish between biomedical and behavioral research, on the one hand, and the practice \nof accepted therapy on the other, in order to know what activities ought to undergo review for the protection \nof human subjects of research. The distinction between research and practice is blurred partly because both \noften occur together (as in research designed to evaluate a therapy) and partly because notable departures \nfrom standard practice are often called \"experimental\" when the terms \"experimental\" and \"research\" are not \ncarefully defined.  \nFor the most part, the term \"practice\" refers to interventions that are designed solely to enhance the well -\nbeing of an individual patient or client and that have a reasonable expectation of success. The purpose of \nmedical or behavioral practice is to provide diagnosis, preventive treatment or therapy to particular \nindividuals  [2]. By contrast, the term \"research' designates an activity designed to test an hypothesis, permit \nconclusions to be drawn, and thereby to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge (expressed, for \nexample, in theories, principles, and statements of relationships). Research is usually described in a formal \nprotocol that sets forth an objective and a set of procedures designed to reach that objective.  \nWhen a clinician departs in a significant way from standard or accepted practice, the innovation does not, in \nand of itself, constitute research. The fact that a procedure is \"experimental,\" in the sense of new, untested \nor different, does not automatically place it in the category of research. Radically new procedures of this  description should, however, be  made the object of formal research at an early stage in order to determine \nwhether they are safe and effective. Thus, it is the responsibility of medical practice committees, for \nexample, to insist that a major innovation be incorporated into a formal research project  [3]. \nResearch and practice may be carried on together when research is designed to evaluate the safety and \nefficacy of a therapy. This need not cause any confusion regarding whether or not the activity requires \nreview; the general rule is that if there is any element of research in an activity, that activity should undergo \nreview for the protection of human subjects.  \n \nPart B: Basic Ethical Principles  \nB. Basic Ethical Principles \nThe expression \"basic ethical principles\" refers to those general judgments that serve as a basic justification \nfor the many particular ethical prescriptions and evaluations of human actions. Three basic principles, \namong those generally accepted in our cultural tradition, are particularly relevant to the ethics of research \ninvolving human subjects: the principles of respect of persons, beneficence and justice.  \n1. Respect for Persons.  — Respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions: first, \nthat individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished \nautonomy are entitled to protection. The principle of respect for persons thus divides into two separate moral \nrequirements: the requirement to acknowledge autonomy and the requirement to protect those with \ndiminished autonomy.  \nAn autonomous person is an individual capable of deliberation about personal goals and of acting under the \ndirection of such deliberation. To respect autonomy is to give weight to autonomous persons' considered \nopinions and choices while refraining from obstructing their actions unless they are clearly detrimental to \nothers. To show lack of respect for an autonomous agent is to repudiate that person's considered \njudgm ents, to deny an individual the freedom to act on those considered judgments, or to withhold \ninformation necessary to make a considered judgment, when there are no compelling reasons to do so.  \nHowever, not every human being is capable of self -determination. The capacity for self -determination \nmatures during an individual's life, and some individuals lose this capacity wholly or in part because of \nillness, mental disability, or circumstances that severely restrict liberty. Respect for the immature and the \nincapacitated may require protecting them as they mature or while they are incapacitated.  \nSome persons are in need of extensive protection, even to the point of excluding them from activities which \nmay harm them; other persons require little protection beyond making sure they undertake activities freely \nand with awareness of possible adverse consequence. The extent of protection afforded should depend \nupon the risk of harm and the likelihood of benefit. The judgment that any individual lacks autonomy should \nbe periodically reevaluated and will vary in different situations.  \nIn most cases of research involving human subjects, respect for persons demands that subjects enter into \nthe research voluntarily and with adequate information. In some situations, however, application of the \nprinciple is not obvious. The involvement of prisoners as subjects of research provides an instructive \nexample. On the one hand, it would seem that the principle of respect for persons requires that prisoners not \nbe deprived of the opportunity to volunteer for research. On the other hand, under prison conditions they \nmay be subtly coerced or unduly influenced to engage in research activities for which they would not \notherwise volunteer. Respect for persons would then dictate that prisoners be protected. Whether to allow prisoners to \"volunteer\" or to \"protect\" them presents a dilemma. Respecting persons, in most hard cases, is \noften a matter of balancing competing claims urged by the principle of respect itself.  \n2. Beneficence.  — Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by respecting their decisions and \nprotecting them from harm, but also by making efforts to secure their well -being. Such treatment falls under \nthe principle of beneficence. The term \"beneficence\" is often understood to cover acts of kindness or charity \nthat go beyond strict obligation. In this document, beneficence is understood in a stronger sense, as an \nobligation. Two general rules have been formulated as complementary expressions of beneficent actions in \nthis sense:  (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.  \nThe Hippocratic maxim \"do no harm\" has long been a fundamental principle of medical ethics. Claude \nBernard extended it to the realm of research, saying that one should not injure one person regardless of the \nbenefits that might come to others. However, even avoiding harm requires learning what is harmful; and, in \nthe process of obtaining this information, persons may be exposed to risk of harm. Further, the Hippocratic \nOath requires physicians to benefit their patients \"according to their best judgment.\" Learning what will in \nfact benefit may require exposing persons to risk. The problem posed by these imperatives is to decide \nwhen it is justifiable to seek certain benefits despite the risks involved, and when the benefits should be \nforegone because of the risks.  \nThe obligations of beneficence affect both individual investigators and society at large, because they extend \nboth to particular research projects and to the entire enterprise of research. In the case of particular projects, \ninvestigators and members of their institutions are obliged to give forethought to the maximization of benefits \nand the reduction of risk that might occur from the research investigation. In the case of scientific research in \ngeneral, members of the larger society are obliged to recognize the longer term benefits and risks that may \nresult from the improvement of knowledge and from the development of novel medical, psychotherapeutic, \nand social procedures.  \nThe principle of beneficence often occupies a well -defined justifying role in many areas of research involving \nhuman subjects. An example is found in research involving children. Effective ways of treating childhood \ndiseas es and fostering healthy development are benefits that serve to justify research involving children -- \neven when individual research subjects are not direct beneficiaries. Research also makes it possible to \navoid the harm that may result from the application of previously accepted routine practices that on closer \ninvestigation turn out to be dangerous. But the role of the principle of beneficence is not always so \nunambiguous. A difficult ethical problem remains, for example, about research that presents more than \nminimal risk without immediate prospect of direct benefit to the children involved. Some have argued that \nsuch research is inadmissible, while others have pointed out that this limit would rule out much research \npromising great benefit to children in the future. Here again, as with all hard cases, the different claims \ncovered by the principle of beneficence may come into conflict and force difficult choices.  \n3. Justice.  — Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens? This is a question of \njustice, in the sense of \"fairness in distribution\" or \"what is deserved.\" An injustice occurs when some benefit \nto which a person is entitled is denied without good reason or when some burden is imposed unduly. \nAnother  way of conceiving the principle of justice is that equals ought to be treated equally. However, this \nstatement requires explication. Who is equal and who is unequal? What considerations justify departure \nfrom equal distribution? Almost all commentators allow that distinctions based on experience, age, \ndeprivation, competence, merit and position do sometimes constitute criteria justifying differential treatment \nfor certain purposes. It is necessary, then, to explain in what respects people should be treated equally. \nThere are several widely accepted formulations of just ways to distribute burdens and benefits. Each \nformulation mentions some relevant property on the basis of which burdens and benefits should be \ndistributed. These formulations are (1) to each person an equal share,  (2) to each person according to \nindividual need,  (3) to each person according to individual effort,  (4) to each person according to societal \ncontribution, and (5) to each person according to merit.  Questions of justice have long been  associated with social practices such as punishment, taxation and \npolitical representation. Until recently these questions have not generally been associated with scientific \nresearch. However, they are foreshadowed even in the earliest reflections on the ethics of research \ninvolving human subjects. For example, during the 19th and early 20th centuries the burdens of serving as \nresearch subjects fell largely upon poor ward patients, while the benefits of improved medical care flowed \nprimarily to private patients. Subsequently, the exploitation of unwilling prisoners as research subjects in \nNazi concentration camps was condemned as a particularly flagrant injustice. In this country, in the 1940's, \nthe Tuskegee syphilis study used disadvantaged, rural black men to study the untreated course of a disease \nthat is by no means confined to that population. These subjects were deprived of demonstrably effective \ntreatment in order not to interrupt the project, long after such treatment became generally available.  \nAgainst this historical background, it can be seen how conceptions of justice are relevant to research \ninvolving human subjects. For example, the selection of research subjects needs to be scrutinized in order \nto determine whether some classes (e.g., welfare patients, particular racial and ethnic minorities, or persons \nconfined to institutions) are being systematically selected simply because of their easy availability, their \ncompromised position, or their manipulability, rather than for reasons directly related to the problem being \nstudied. Finally, whenever research supported by public funds leads to the development of therapeutic \ndevices and procedures, justice demands both that these not provide advantages only to those who can \nafford them and that such research should not unduly involve persons from groups unlikely to be among the \nbeneficiaries of subsequent applications of the research.  \n \nPart C: Applications  \nC. Applications \nApplications of the general principles to the conduct of research leads to consideration of the following \nrequirements: informed consent, risk/benefit assessment, and the selection of subjects of research.  \n1. Informed Consent.  — Respect for persons requires that subjects, to the degree that they are \ncapable, be given the opportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them. This opportunity is \nprovided when adequate standards for informed consent are satisfied.  \nWhile the importance of informed consent is unquestioned, controversy  prevails over the nature and \npossibility of an informed consent. Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that the consent process \ncan be analyzed as containing three elements: information, comprehension and voluntariness.  \nInformation.  Most codes of research establish specific items for disclosure intended to assure that subjects \nare given sufficient information. These items generally include: the research procedure, their purposes, risks \nand anticipated benefits, alternative procedures (where therapy  is involved), and a statement offering the \nsubject the opportunity to ask questions and to withdraw at any time from the research. Additional items \nhave been proposed, including how subjects are selected, the person responsible for the research, etc.  \nHowe ver, a simple listing of items does not answer the question of what the standard should be for judging \nhow much and what sort of information should be provided. One standard frequently invoked in medical \npractice, namely the information commonly provided by practitioners in the field or in the locale, is \ninadequate since research takes place precisely when a common understanding does not exist. Another \nstandard, currently popular in malpractice law, requires the practitioner to reveal the information that \nreasonable persons would wish to know in order to make a decision regarding their care. This, too, seems \ninsufficient since the research subject, being in essence a volunteer, may wish to know considerably more \nabout risks gratuitously undertaken than do patients who deliver themselves into the hand of a clinician for needed care. It may be that a standard of \"the reasonable volunteer\" should be proposed: the extent and \nnature of information should be such that persons, knowing that the procedure is neither necessary for their \ncare nor perhaps fully understood, can decide whether they wish to participate in the furthering of \nknowledge. Even when some direct benefit to them is anticipated, the subjects should understand clearly the \nrange of risk and the voluntary nature of participation.  \nA special problem of consent arises where informing subjects of some pertinent aspect of the research is \nlikely to impair the validity of the research. In many cases, it is sufficient to indicate to subjects that they are \nbeing invited to participate in research of which some features will not be revealed until the research is \nconcluded. In all cases of research involving incomplete disclosure, such research is justified only if it is \nclear that  (1) incomplete disclosure is truly necessary to accomplish the goals of the research,  (2) there are \nno undisclosed risks to subjects that are more than minimal, and  (3) there is an adequate plan for debriefing \nsubjects, when appropriate, and for dissemination of research results to them. Information about risks \nshould never be withheld for the purpose of eliciting the cooperation of subjects, and truthful answers should \nalways be given to direct questions about the research. Care should be taken to distinguish cases in which \ndisclosure wou ld destroy or invalidate the research from cases in which disclosure would simply \ninconvenience the investigator.  \nComprehension.  The manner and context in which information is conveyed is as important as the \ninformation itself. For example, presenting information in a disorganized and rapid fashion, allowing too little \ntime for consideration or curtailing opportunities for questioning, all may adversely affect a subject's ability to \nmake an informed choice.  \nBecause the subject's ability to understand is  a function of intelligence, rationality, maturity and language, it \nis necessary to adapt the presentation of the information to the subject's capacities. Investigators are \nresponsible for ascertaining that the subject has comprehended the information. While there is always an \nobligation to ascertain that the information about risk to subjects is complete and adequately comprehended, \nwhen the risks are more serious, that obligation increases. On occasion, it may be suitable to give some oral \nor written tests of comprehension.  \nSpecial provision may need to be made when comprehension is severely limited -- for example, by \nconditions of immaturity or mental disability. Each class of subjects that one might consider as incompetent \n(e.g., infants and young children, mentally disable patients, the terminally ill and the comatose) should be \nconsidered on its own terms. Even for these persons, however, respect requires giving them the opportunity \nto choose to the extent they are able, whether or not to participate in research. The objections of these \nsubjects to involvement should be honored, unless the research entails providing them a therapy \nunavailable elsewhere. Respect for persons also requires seeking the permission of other parties in order to \nprotect the subjects from harm. Such persons are thus respected both by acknowledging their own wishes \nand by the use of third parties to protect them from harm.  \nThe third parties chosen should be those who are most likely to understand the incompetent subject's \nsituation and to act in that person's best interest. The person authorized to act on behalf of the subject \nshould be given an opportunity to observe the research as it proceeds in order to be able to withdraw the \nsubject from the research, if such action appears in the subject's best interest.  \nVoluntariness.  An agreement to participate in research constitutes a valid consent only if voluntarily given. \nThis element of informed consent requires conditions free of coercion and undue influence. Coercion occurs \nwhen an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain \ncompliance. Undue influence, by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive, unwarranted, \ninappropriate or improper reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance. Also, inducements that \nwould ordinarily be acceptable may become undue influences if the subject is especially vulnerable.  \nUnjustifiable pressures usually occur when persons in positions of authority or commanding influence -- \nespecially where possible sanctions are involved -- urge a course of action for a subject. A continuum of such influencing factors exists, however, and it is impossible to state precisely where justifiable persuasion \nends and undue influence begins. But undue influence would include actions such as manipulating a \nperson's choice through the controlling influence of a close relative and threatening to withdraw health \nservices to which an individual would otherwise be entitled.  \n2. Assessment of Risks a nd Benefits.  — The assessment of risks and benefits requires a \ncareful arrayal of relevant data, including, in some cases, alternative ways of obtaining the benefits sought in \nthe research. Thus, the assessment presents both an opportunity and a responsibility to gather systematic \nand comprehensive information about proposed research. For the investigator, it is a means to examine \nwhether the proposed research is properly designed. For a review committee, it is a method for determining \nwhether the risks that will be presented to subjects are justified. For prospective subjects, the assessment \nwill assist the determination whether or not to participate.  \nThe Nature and Scope of Risks and Benefits.  The requirement that research be justified on the basis of a  \nfavorable risk/benefit assessment bears a close relation to the principle of beneficence, just as the moral \nrequirement that informed consent be obtained is derived primarily from the principle of respect for persons. \nThe term \"risk\" refers to a possibili ty that harm may occur. However, when expressions such as \"small risk\" \nor \"high risk\" are used, they usually refer (often ambiguously) both to the chance (probability) of \nexperiencing a harm and the severity (magnitude) of the envisioned harm.  \nThe term \"benefit\" is used in the research context to refer to something of positive value related to health or \nwelfare. Unlike, \"risk,\" \"benefit\" is not a term that expresses probabilities. Risk is properly contrasted to \nprobability of benefits, and benefits are properly contrasted with harms rather than risks of harm. \nAccordingly, so -called risk/benefit assessments are concerned with the probabilities and magnitudes of \npossible harm and anticipated benefits. Many kinds of possible harms and benefits need to be taken into \naccount. There are, for example, risks of psychological harm, physical harm, legal harm, social harm and \neconomic harm and the corresponding benefits. While the most likely types of harms to research subjects \nare those of psychological or physical pain or injury, other possible kinds should not be overlooked.  \nRisks and benefits of research may affect the individual subjects, the families of the individual subjects, and \nsociety at large (or special groups of subjects in society). Previous codes and Federal regulations have \nrequired that risks to subjects be outweighed by the sum of both the anticipated benefit to the subject, if any, \nand the anticipated benefit to society in the form of knowledge to be gained from the research. In balancing \nthese different elements, the risks and benefits affecting the immediate research subject will normally carry \nspecial weight. On the other hand, interests other than those of the subject may on some occasions be \nsufficient by themselves to justify the risks involved in the research, so long as the subjects' rights have been \nprotected. Beneficence thus requires that we protect against risk of harm to subjects and also that we be \nconcerned about the loss of the substantial benefits that might be gained from research.  \nThe Systematic Assessment of Risks and Benefits.  It is commonly said that benefits and risks must be \n\"balanced\" and shown to be \"in a favorable ratio.\" The metaphorical character of these terms draws \nattention to the difficulty of making precise judgments. Only on rare occasions will quantitative techniques be \navailable for the scrutiny of research protocols. However, the idea of systematic, nonarbitrary analysis of \nrisks and benefits should be emulated insofar as possible. This ideal requires those making deci sions about \nthe justifiability of research to be thorough in the accumulation and assessment of information about all \naspects of the research, and to consider alternatives systematically. This procedure renders the assessment \nof research more rigorous and precise, while making communication between review board members and \ninvestigators less subject to misinterpretation, misinformation and conflicting judgments. Thus, there should \nfirst be a determination of the validity of the presuppositions of the research; then the nature, probability and \nmagnitude of risk should be distinguished with as much clarity as possible. The method of ascertaining risks \nshould be explicit, especially where there is no alternative to the use of such vague categories as small or \nslight risk. It should also be determined whether an investigator's estimates of the probability of harm or \nbenefits are reasonable, as judged by known facts or other available studies.  Finally, assessment of the justifiability of research should reflect at  least the following \nconsiderations:  (i)Brutal or inhumane treatment of human subjects is never morally justified.  (ii) Risks should \nbe reduced to those necessary to achieve the research objective. It should be determined whether it is in \nfact necessary to use human subjects at all. Risk can perhaps never be entirely eliminated, but it can often \nbe reduced by careful attention to alternative procedures.  (iii) When research involves significant risk of \nserious impairment, review committees should be extraordinarily insistent on the justification of the risk \n(looking usually to the likelihood of benefit to the subject -- or, in some rare cases, to the manifest \nvoluntariness of the participation).  (iv) When vulnerable populations are involved in research, the \nappropriateness of involving them should itself be demonstrated. A number of variables go into such \njudgments, including the nature and degree of risk, the condition of the particular population involved, and \nthe nature and level of the anticipated benefits . (v) Relevant risks and benefits must be thoroughly arrayed \nin documents and procedures used in the informed consent process.  \n3. Selection of Subjects.  — Just as the principle of respect for persons finds expression in the \nrequirements for consent, and the principle of beneficence in risk/benefit assessment, the principle of justice \ngives rise to moral requirements that there be fair procedures and outcomes in the selection of research \nsubjects.  \nJustice is relevant to the selection of subjects of research at two levels: the social and the individual. \nIndividual justice in the selection of subjects would require that researchers exhibit fairness: thus, they \nshould not offer potentially beneficial research only to some patients  who are in their favor or select only \n\"undesirable\" persons for risky research. Social justice requires that distinction be drawn between classes of \nsubjects that ought, and ought not, to participate in any particular kind of research, based on the abilit y of \nmembers of that class to bear burdens and on the appropriateness of placing further burdens on already \nburdened persons. Thus, it can be considered a matter of social justice that there is an order of preference \nin the selection of classes of subjects  (e.g., adults before children) and that some classes of potential \nsubjects (e.g., the institutionalized mentally infirm or prisoners) may be involved as research subjects, if at \nall, only on certain conditions.  \nInjustice may appear in the selection of subjects, even if individual subjects are selected fairly by \ninvestigators and treated fairly in the course of research. Thus injustice arises from social, racial, sexual and \ncultural biases institutionalized in society. Thus, even if individual researchers are treating their research \nsubjects fairly, and even if IRBs are taking care to assure that subjects are selected fairly within a particular \ninstitution, unjust social patterns may nevertheless appear in the overall distribution of the burdens and \nbenefits  of research. Although individual institutions or investigators may not be able to resolve a problem \nthat is pervasive in their social setting, they can consider distributive justice in selecting research subjects.  \nSome populations, especially institutionalized ones, are already burdened in many ways by their infirmities \nand environments. When research is proposed that involves risks and does not include a therapeutic \ncomponent, other less burdened classes of persons should be called upon first to accept these risks of \nresearch, except where the research is directly related to the specific conditions of the class involved. Also, \neven though public funds for research may often flow in the same directions as public funds for health care, \nit seems unfair that populations dependent on public health care constitute a pool of preferred research \nsubjects if more advantaged populations are likely to be the recipients of the benefits.  \nOne special instance of injustice results from the involvement of vulnerable subjects. Certain groups, such \nas racial minorities, the economically disadvantaged, the very sick, and the institutionalized may continually \nbe sought as research subjects, owing to their ready availability in settings where research is conducted. \nGiven their dependent status and their frequently compromised capacity for free consent, they should be \nprotected against the danger of being involved in research solely for administrative convenience, or because \nthey are easy to manipulate as a result of their illness or socioeconomic condition.  \n  \n[1] Since 1945, various codes for the proper and responsible conduct of human experimentation in medical research have been \nadopted by different organizations. The best known of these codes are the Nuremberg Code of 1947, the Helsinki Declaration of \n1964 (revised in 1975), and the 1971 Guidelines (codified into Federal Regulations in 1974) issued by the U.S. Department of \nHealth, Education, and Welfare Codes for the conduct of social and behavioral research have also been adopted, the best known \nbeing that of the American Psychological Association, published in 1973. \n[2] Although practice usually involves interventions designed solely to enhance the well-being of a particular individual, interventions \nare sometimes applied to one individual for the enhancement of the well-being of another (e.g., blood donation, skin grafts, organ \ntransplants) or an intervention may have the dual purpose of enhancing the well-being of a particular individual, and, at the same \ntime, providing some benefit to others (e.g., vaccination, which protects both the person who is vaccinated and society generally). \nThe fact that some forms of practice have elements other than immediate benefit to the individual receiving an intervention, \nhowever, should not confuse the general distinction between research and practice. Even when a procedure applied in practice may \nbenefit some other person, it remains an intervention designed to enhance the well-being of a particular individual or groups of \nindividuals; thus, it is practice and need not be reviewed as research. \n[3] Because the problems related to social experimentation may differ substantially from those of biomedical and behavioral \nresearch, the Commission specifically declines to make any policy determination regarding such research at this time. Rather, the \nCommission believes that the problem ought to be addressed by one of its successor bodies. \n "

The field of ethics / moral philosophy\nhas for centuries considered what it means to be “morally\ngood” or at least “morally allowed / acceptable”. Among phi-\nlosophy’s contributions are (1) frameworks for evaluating the\nmorality of actions — including the well-established conse-\nquentialist and deontological frameworks — and (2) scenarios\n(like trolley problems) featuring moral dilemmas that can fa-\ncilitate discussion about and intellectual inquiry into different\nperspectives on moral reasoning and decision-making. In a\nclassic trolley problem, consequentialist and deontological\nanalyses may render different outcomes. In this research, we\nexplicitly make and explore connections between moral ques-\ntions in computer security research and ethics / moral philoso-\nphy through the creation and analysis of trolley problem-like\ncomputer security-themed moral dilemmas and, in doing so,\nwe seek to contribute to conversations among security re-\nsearchers about the morality of security research-related deci-\nsions. We explicitly do notseek to define what is morally right\nor wrong, nor do we argue for one framework over another. In-\ndeed, the consequentialist and deontological frameworks that\nwe center, in addition to coming to different conclusions for\nour scenarios, have significant limitations. Instead, by offering\nour scenarios and by comparing two different approaches to\nethics, we strive to contribute to how the computer security\nresearch field considers and converses about ethical questions,\nespecially when there are different perspectives on what is\nmorally right or acceptable. Our vision is for this work to be\nbroadly useful to the computer security community, including\nto researchers as they embark on (or choose not to embark\non), conduct, and write about their research, to program com-\nmittees as they evaluate submissions, and to educators as they\nteach about computer security and ethics.\n1 Introduction\nWe believe in the essentiality of maintaining high ethical\nstandards when conducting and evaluating computer securityresearch. As examples of the field’s1commitment to moral\nconsiderations, conference program committees are leverag-\ning ethics review boards and authors are discussing ethics\nin submissions. There also exist tools to help community\nmembers make adequate moral decisions, such as the 2012\nMenlo Report [56] and recent author guidelines in security\nconference calls for papers.\nHowever, challenges still arise. Central to these challenges\nis that in some cases there may notbe universal agreement on\nwhat constitutes an adequate decision. Consider, for example,\na hypothetical scenario (our Scenario A) in which researchers\nfind a vulnerability in a wireless implantable medical device.\nAssume that the device manufacturer is out of business and,\nhence, it is impossible to patch the vulnerability. Also, as-\nsume that there is zero chance of the vulnerability ever being\nexploited, even if adversaries know about it.2Should the re-\nsearchers disclose the vulnerability to the government and\nthe public, thereby respecting patients’ right to be informed\n(a key component of the “respect for persons” principle of\nthe Menlo Report [56] as well as the earlier Belmont Re-\nport [54] and the principle of “autonomy” in the Principles of\nBiomedical Ethics [7])? Or, should the researchers, knowing\nthat adversaries would never manifest but that a knowledge of\nthe vulnerability’s existence could harm patients (who might\nremove the device from their bodies and hence lose the health\nbenefits out of unnecessary concerns), not disclose the vulner-\nability to the government and the public (thereby respecting\nthe principle of “beneficence” and the avoidance of harm,\nanother core element of the Menlo Report [56], the Belmont\nReport [54], and the Principles of Biomedical Ethics [7])?\nThere are strong arguments for both decisions. In a situa-\ntion with conflicting arguments, how are we as a field to make\n1When we say “the field”, we refer to the computer security research field\neven though our team is composed of both computer security researchers and\na moral philosopher. We use this terminology because our primary goal is to\ncontribute to the computer security research field.\n2To enable us to focus on the philosophical aspects of ethics and moral-\nity and not become entangled in real-world details, we make simplifying\nassumptions in this and all our scenarios. We elaborate on this decision in\nSection 3.\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    5145the right decision? We argue that whatever process is used,\nthat process will benefit from being informed by philosophy’s\nunderstanding of the different approaches that people take to\nethics — approaches that canresult in different people com-\ning to different conclusions. Hence, our research. In short,\nwe seek to contribute to future conversations about what is\nmorally right, good, or allowed, and we do so by studying how,\nfrom a philosophical perspective, to have such discussions.\nEthics and Moral Philosophy. The field of ethics / moral\nphilosophy centers the question of what it means to be “good”,\n“morally right”, or “morally allowed” (i.e., not prescribed but\nalso not forbidden). Even in the field of philosophy, there\nis no consensus for what this exactly means. But, there is a\nmature understanding for how to discuss what it might mean.\nConversations about “good” and “bad” begin by centering a\nperspective — an ethical framework .\nEthical Frameworks. Ethical frameworks define approaches\nfor reasoning about what is morally right or wrong, i.e., what\nis “good” or “bad”. Two of today’s leading frameworks (or,\nmore precisely, categories of frameworks) are consequential-\nistanddeontological ethics . Consequentialist ethics centers\nquestions about the impacts (consequences) of different de-\ncisions. Under consequentialist ethics, one might assess the\nbenefits and harms of different options before making a deci-\nsion that maximizes net benefits. Deontological ethics centers\nquestions about duties (deon) and rights. Under deontological\nethics, one might ask what rights different stakeholders have,\ne.g., a right to privacy or a right to autonomy.\nWe center consequentialist and deontological ethics — and\nin particular utilitarianism and Kantian deontological ethics,\nrespectively (Section 4) — in our study because of (1) their\nprominence in the field of ethics / moral philosophy (they are\ntwo of the three leading frameworks) and (2) their existing\nimpact on the computer security research field’s approach to\nethics and morality (e.g., the Menlo Report [56] derives from\nthe Belmont Report [54], which itself embeds both conse-\nquentialist and deontological elements). We stress, however,\nthat both consequentialist and deontological ethics have lim-\nitations and that by centering them we are notarguing that\nanyone adopt a strict consequentialist or deontological per-\nspective. At a minimum, one might include considerations\nfrom both frameworks, as the Menlo Report [56] does. As\nwe discuss more in Section 3, modern frameworks include\na more critical perspective. Additionally, much of philoso-\nphy’s discussion of consequentialist and deontological ethics\ncenters a Western perspective. While Western frameworks\nencompass ethical considerations that are part of non-Western\ntraditions (e.g., about duties towards each other, the nature of\nfundamentally relating to each other, the outcomes of actions\n/ policies, and so on), each tradition has its own unique history\nand elements. Although outside the scope of this work, we\nencourage the computer security research community to gain\ngreater familiarity with other frameworks as well.Our Work. As exemplified by the Menlo Report [56] and\nrecent calls for papers, there are already connections between\nthe computer security research field and ethics / moral philos-\nophy. Our assessment is that many of these connections are\nimplicit. We seek to make these connections explicit and, by\ndoing so, contribute to how the field discusses and considers\nmoral questions.\nTo do our research, we composed a team of researchers\nconsisting of both those trained in computer security research\nandthose trained in moral philosophy. The computer security\nresearchers on our team have significant prior work addressing\nand discussing ethical questions in computer security research.\nHowever, prior to this collaboration, the security researchers\napproached ethics from a “we should be good” and “having\nthought carefully and talked with others, I think this is right”\napproach rather than from an approach informed by ethics\n/ moral philosophy. The moral philosopher on our team has\nsignificant prior work in applied ethics outside of computer\nsecurity. Our work is thus cross-disciplinary and could be\nread as both a work in philosophy (particularly normative\nand applied ethics) and (we believe) a contribution to the\ncomputer security research field.\nGoals, Methods, and Findings. We seek to leverage tools\nand insights from ethics / moral philosophy to facilitate clear,\nthoughtful, and rigorous conversations within the computer\nsecurity research field about what are morally right or allowed\ndecisions / policies / institutions — i.e., we seek to contribute\ntohow the field discusses moral questions. We do notseek to\ndefine what (morally) “right” or “good” means (which would\nbe a metaethical question).\nOur methodology is to:\n•Develop computer security scenarios reminiscent of clas-\nsical ethical dilemmas and for which evaluations under\ndifferent ethical frameworks justify different outcomes;\nour scenarios are akin to philosophy’s classic trolley\nproblems, which we describe later. (Section 3.)\n•Explore those computer security scenarios using both\nconsequentialist (utilitarianism) and (Kantian) deonto-\nlogical analyses. (Section 5.)\n•Develop additional computer security scenarios that, in-\ndividually, may not pose ethical dilemmas (i.e., there\nmay be stronger agreement for what constitutes a morally\nright or allowed decision for some scenarios) but that,\ntogether, facilitate deeper explorations about moral con-\nsiderations within the field. (See the full version of this\npaper [34].)\n•Reflect upon the above scenarios and explorations and\nderive lessons about how to have informed conversa-\ntions about ethics and morality in the computer security\nresearch community. (Section 6.)\n5146    32nd USENIX Security Symposium USENIX AssociationSummary of Our Three Main Scenarios. We summarized\nScenario A above. Scenario B explores the morality of study-\ning stolen data — data that people did not intend to be public.\nScenario C explores what to do if a program committee mem-\nber encounters a submission containing undisclosed infor-\nmation about their company’s product. All our scenarios are\nbased on actual situations encountered within the computer\nsecurity research community, though we modified the scenar-\nios to make them more conducive to ethical analyses, per our\nresearch goals. While reflective of real-world scenarios, our\nscenarios do not cover the full spectrum of moral dilemmas\nencountered within the security research community, nor is it\nour intent to do so.\nExample Use Case of Our Results: Program Committee\nDiscussions. The security researchers on this team have on\nmultiple occasions encountered the following situation:\n•A paper is submitted to a peer-reviewed conference. The\npaper reports on work that one program committee mem-\nber flags as possibly unethical.\n•Program committee members discuss the morality of the\nwork but cannot agree; some committee members think\nit was ethical, and others think it was not.\nSuch disagreements can be challenging if, for example,\nsome committee members adopt consequentialist perspectives\nand other committee members adopt deontological perspec-\ntives, but the committee members do not realize that they are\nusing different frameworks for evaluating morality. Prior to\nthis collaboration, we (the security researchers on this team)\ndid not have the tools and language to untangle such disagree-\nments. Now, through this collaboration and the exploration\nof computer security scenarios via the consequentialist and\ndeontological frameworks, we have that language.\nExample Use Case of Our Results: Discussing Research\nPath. In many cases, there may already exist clarity for re-\nsearchers on how to navigate moral questions, e.g., researchers\nmight follow the recommendations in the Menlo Report [56].\nHowever, there may remain times when clarity does not ex-\nist, e.g., when there are tensions between what is morally\nright from a benefits / harms perspective (consequentialist\nethics) and what is right from a duties / rights perspective\n(deontological ethics). Through the articulation of established\nethical frameworks, and through the exploration of computer\nsecurity scenarios via these frameworks, we hope to help re-\nsearchers have more methodical and informed discussions\nabout ethics and morality when there are such tensions. Since\ndifferent frameworks can lead to different conclusions of\nwhat is morally right, however, we stress that the frameworks\nshould notbe used to justify a path that researchers have a\npriori decided that they want to take. Rather, we argue that the\nethically correct process is to center ethics in the decision of\nwhether or not to do a research project or do some component\nof the research and accept that sometimes the answer is “no”.Publication Information.

In Western culture, the most well-known ethical frame-\nworks are virtue ethics (most notably developed by ancient\nGreek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle), deontolog-\nical ethics (a famous example from German Enlightenment\nphilosopher Immanuel Kant), and utilitarianism (an example\nof consequentialist ethics, first developed by Jeremy Ben-\ntham and John Stuart Mill). In other cultures, classic ethical\nframeworks include Confucianism, Daoism (as first coined\nby Laozi), and Ubuntu.\nAs a field that is centuries old and spans cultures and histo-\nries, it is natural that there is no universal consensus on what,\nprecisely, ethics and morality mean. For our work, we use\nethics / moral philosophy to refer to the (scientific) explo-\nration of how to consider, evaluate, and discuss moral ques-\ntions,3andmorality to refer to the object of this exploration.\nFor example, ethicists / moral philosophers use ethics in the\nsense of moral reasoning to determine whether an action,\nsocial institution, or set of norms is moral or not [22].\nModern ethicists often use ethics andmorality interchange-\nably.4Thus, the computer security field is not wrong in its\nuse of the term ethics to encompass both ethics and morality.\nWhen precision is not necessary, we may do so as well.\nWe provide a deeper background on ethical frameworks in\nSection 4.\n2.2 Ethics and Computer Security Research\nThe field of computer security research has a long history\nwith questions of ethics and morality. This history includes re-\nsearch directions that required significant ethical forethought\nand planning before implementation as well as research\nprojects that, upon completion, raised concerns within the\ncommunity. We touch on elements of this history in more\ndetail in the full version of this paper [34]. We focus here on\nhistorical elements particularly relevant to our philosophical\nexplorations.\nIn the U.S., the 1976 Belmont Report [54] serves as a foun-\ndation for the ethical treatment of research subjects (human\nsubjects) within universities. European universities and other\nresearch institutions may reference general “good scientific\n3Whereas “moral philosophy” refers to a mainly philosophical endeavor,\n“ethics” also comprises non-strictly-philosophical (e.g., theological) reason-\ning.\n4Against this, Habermas argues that “ethics” refers to questions about the\ngood life, whereas “morality” is concerned with what we owe others [25].\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    5147A Classic Dilemma: The Trolley Problem\nContext:\n• A runaway trolley with no brakes is heading straight along a set of tracks.\n• Five people are tied to those tracks.\n• One person is tied to an alternate set of tracks.\n• A trolley operator has the ability to change the trolley’s path and make it head down the alternate set of tracks.\nThe choice for the trolley operator:\n•Do nothing: Five people die.\n•Make the trolley take the alternate set of tracks: One person dies.\nFigure 1: The trolley problem is a classic thought experiment / ethical dilemma.\npractices”, and may discuss dual use of research results (civil-\nian and military), but often omit formal ethics reviews of\nresearch ideas, leaving the ethical decisions to researchers.\nThe 2012 Menlo Report [56] applies the Belmont Report’s\nprinciples of justice, beneficence, and respect for humans (not\njust human subjects) to computer security research. In doing\nso, the Menlo Report highlights that computer security re-\nsearch may impact computer systems and their users beyond\nconsenting participants. As an applied ethics framework, the\nMenlo Report [56] makes ethical practices and thought ac-\ncessible to a broad audience. The Menlo Report [56] is now\nexplicitly referenced in the 2022 and 2023 IEEE Symposium\non Security & Privacy and the 2023 USENIX Security call\nfor papers. Our work is motivated, in part, by our belief that\nthe application of the Menlo Report, and security ethics con-\nversations in general, can be further enriched with a greater\nunderstanding of ethics / moral philosophy.\n2.3 A Classic Moral Dilemma\nEthicists / moral philosophers have, for generations, proposed\ndilemmas for ethical debate and consideration. A classic\ndilemma (or, more precisely, family of dilemmas) are the\n“trolley problems”. These are dilemmas because they present a\nchoice between two options, both of which contain undesired\naspects. Therefore, different ethical frameworks potentially\npresent different answers to such dilemmas. Some authors\n(among them Philippa Foot herself, who came up with the\noriginal trolley problem [20]) take them to show that people’s\nmoral intuitions will most likely diverge in important cases.\nFigure 1 presents an archetypical trolley problem. In this\ntrolley problem, a runaway trolley with no brakes is heading\nstraight down a track. Five people are tied to that track. A\ntrolley operator is watching the trolley. They could do nothing,\nin which case five people would die. The trolley operator\ncould, however, choose to redirect the trolley down a second,adjacent track. If the operator does so, then the trolley would\nkill only one person — the person tied to that adjacent track.\nPhilosophers and psychologists have studied people’s re-\nsponses to trolley problems such as in Figure 1 and, in-\ndeed, there is no universal consensus for what constitutes\nthe morally correct action of the trolley operator [20]. In psy-\nchology studies, for example, differences can arise due to the\nmoral intuitions and values of the participant and may vary\nby culture, e.g., [3, 12, 13, 24, 36, 59].\nVariants of the trolley problem feature different outcomes\nand can elicit different thought processes and decisions.5As\nan example variant, the single person on the alternate track\nmight be a young child whereas the five people on the main\ntrack might already be near death. As another variant, the\nfive people tied to the main track might have tied themselves\nthere intentionally whereas the single person on the other\ntrack might be there against their will. Or, the five people on\nthe main track might have been convicted of war crimes by\nan international tribunal whereas the person on the alternate\ntrack is known to have led a virtuous life.\n3 Computer Security Trolley Problems\n3.1 Scenario Generation Process\nOur research team used a collaborative and interactive process\nfor scenario generation. After discussing our initial approach,\nwe present our final methodology and scenario selection cri-\nteria.\nInitial Approach. Initially, the security researchers on the\nteam created scenarios representative of scenarios that we\n(the security researchers) had previously encountered (e.g.,\nas program committee members or as researchers). Our team\n5An interactive exploration of different trolley problems is available at\nhttps://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/ .\n5148    32nd USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Associationgenerated dozens of such scenarios with an initial goal of\nexhaustively and systematically surfacing the full spectrum\nof ethical considerations encountered within our field. While\nthe generative process was important toward normalizing an\nunderstanding of scenarios and moral issues in the field across\nthe entire team (including both the security researchers and\nthe philosopher), these scenarios had several key limitations:\n•Too late. Some scenarios were framed as “a program\ncommittee member reads a conference submission in\nwhich the authors did such-and-such; the program com-\nmittee member believes that such-and-such should not\nhave been done; should the program committee accept\nthe paper?”\n•Open-ended. Other scenarios were very open-ended\nand highly unconstrained, e.g., “here is an issue that a\nresearch group encountered, what should they do?”\n•Not a dilemma. Some scenarios had relatively clear\nand uncontroversial moral implications; we encountered\nthem as program committee members because (for exam-\nple) of an oversight by the authors of a paper submission,\ne.g., because the authors assumed that the IRB process\nwas sufficient to cover all aspects of moral decision-\nmaking.\n•Indecisive. Some of our scenarios did not have conclu-\nsive decisions under different ethical frameworks, at least\nnot without significant additional information that would\ngreatly expand the scenarios and make them unwieldy.\nThe “too late” scenarios all shared a common theme: re-\nsearchers made decision X, for some X; what should the pro-\ngram committee do if they question the morality of X? A\ndiscussion of the ethical processes for program committees\nwhen encountering such papers is important, and indeed we\nconsider a family of such scenarios in the full version of this\npaper [34]. For our core ethical dilemmas (this section), we\nsought scenarios featuring a decision before a controversial\nactXis committed in the first place. As a concrete exam-\nple, for our Scenario B (to be described), an initial version\nfeatured a scenario in which a program committee reviews a\npaper that studies data that some program committee mem-\nbers believe should not have been studied. What should the\nprogram committee do? Our final Scenario B asks: should\nresearchers study that data?\nThe “open-ended” scenarios, while representative of what\nresearchers might encounter in the real world, made anal-\nyses of the scenarios under established ethical frameworks\ntoo unconstrained for focused treatments. As evidenced by\nour team’s internal discussions, when faced with open-ended\nquestions of the form “what should the researchers do?”, it is\npossible to spend hours, and hence volumes of written pages,\nexploring different possible paths forward. While for some\nscenarios such explorations would be important contributionsof their own, those are not the contributions we sought with\nthis work. Rather, we wanted scenarios conducive to short,\nprecise, and focused analyses with minimal (binary) options.\nThe “not a dilemma” scenarios were intellectually inter-\nesting and important in establishing our team’s shared un-\nderstanding of questions of morality and computer security\nresearch. However, because these scenarios were not actual\ndilemmas, evaluation under different ethical frameworks re-\nsulted in the same conclusions and hence were not as gener-\native of philosophical explorations as scenarios that yielded\ndifferent conclusions under different ethical frameworks. In\nshort, we sought scenarios for which people — including\ncomputer security research community members — might,\nthrough sound reasoning, plausibly disagree.\nThe “indecisive” scenarios featured decisions for which\nall possible choices would result in “comparable” benefits /\nharms that would need extensive empirical work to assess. In\nthe real world, if one were to encounter such a situation, a sig-\nnificant portion of the conversation might center on assessing\nthose empirical claims. For our work, we wanted to center\nethical and moral thought processes, not empirical questions.\nHence, we sought scenarios without complicated benefits /\nharms calculus.\nRevised Approach: Criteria, Creation, and Validation. In-\nformed by the results of our analyses of and conversations\nabout our initial scenarios, our team developed the following\ncriteria for scenario generation:\n•Early. We sought scenarios that featured moral questions\nthat actors (e.g., researchers) might encounter about their\nown future actions, not questions about what to do after\nit has been determined that researchers have already\ncommitted a morally questionable act.\n•Binary options. We sought scenarios that — like the trol-\nley problems — have binary options for some actor (e.g.,\nthe trolley operator in the trolley problem in Figure 1 or\na research team in computer security-related scenarios).\n•Dilemmas. We sought scenarios that were true dilemmas.\nSpecifically, we sought scenarios for which analyses un-\nder consequentialist and deontological ethics would yield\ndifferent conclusions.\n•Decisive. We sought scenarios for which analyses un-\nder the consequentialist and deontological ethical frame-\nworks were clear, straightforward, and decisive. Some-\ntimes this came at the cost of simplifying and artificially\ncontrasting the ethical traditions to bring out key differ-\nences in perspective and focus.\nOur research team iterated extensively on the creation of\nscenarios that satisfied these criteria, over regular meetings\nthroughout late summer and fall 2022 and early 2023. Our\niteration was both at a high level, focusing on the scenario’s\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    5149overall setup and context, and at a low level, focusing on fine\nnuances and details. As we iterated on these scenarios, we\npresented variants in university seminars (at other universi-\nties) and in courses (at the undergraduate and graduate levels).\nAfter each presentation, we reflected upon and revised the\nscenarios as needed to address ambiguities or clarify key as-\npects relevant to the scenarios’ intended moral questions. We\nadditionally shared our scenarios with others in the computer\nsecurity research community for feedback.\nIn addition to being instrumental to the process of sce-\nnario creation, this iterative process also served as scenario\nvalidation. Specifically, the iterative process with systematic\nphilosophical analyses and external discussions helped us\nvalidate that our scenarios met our “dilemmas” and “deci-\nsive” criteria. (That our scenarios met the “early” and “binary\noptions” criteria was easy to assess by construction.)\nBased on Reality, But Not Real. We stress that although\nour final scenarios are based on reality, they are notrealistic.\nReal-world scenarios generally do not present only a binary\noption to decision-makers — they present a medley of options.\nAdditionally, to enable precise analyses under different ethi-\ncal frameworks, our scenarios minimize uncertainty. The real\nworld, on the other hand, is full of uncertainty, e.g., uncer-\ntainty about when or if an adversary might manifest or the\nactual benefits / harms of a technology or exploit. Thus, assess-\ning benefits / harms (for consequentialist ethics) and rights\nviolations (for deontological ethics) is significantly more chal-\nlenging in the real world than in our scenarios. Real-world\nscenarios may have multiple actors simultaneously making\ndecisions, each of which might impact the other actors; in our\nscenarios, we consider only a single decision-maker. Addi-\ntionally, to simplify our analyses, we reduce the impacts of\ndecisions on the decision maker in our core scenarios (Sce-\nnarios A, B, and C); we add such impacts into some of the\nsupplementary scenarios in the full version of this paper [34].\nIn the real world, decision-makers may involve others in the\ndecision-making process; our scenario descriptions do not\npreclude such discussions but leave the final decision in the\nhands of the specified decision-maker rather than allow for the\ntransference of the decision responsibility to another entity\n(e.g., a committee or government).\nThe Structure of a Scenario. For each scenario, we use a\nstructure similar to Figure 1 for the trolley problem. Each\nscenario centers a decision-maker and has:\n•Context: The “context” of the scenario provides the\nbackground context for the decision that the actor needs\nto make.\n•Choice: The “choice” of the scenario describes two op-\ntions that the actor must choose between.\nWe use prose to describe the context and choice. The full\nversion of this paper [34] provides figures, like Figure 1, for\neach scenario.3.2 Scenario A: Medical Device Vulnerability\nScenario A centers around researchers who discover a vulner-\nability in a wireless implantable medical device.\nContext. Researchers found a vulnerability in a wireless im-\nplantable medical device made by a manufacturer that is no\nlonger in business. Existing patients still use the device and\nnew patients are still receiving the device. It is not possible to\nupdate the software on the device and patch the vulnerability.\nEven if the researchers disclose the vulnerability to the public,\nthere is zero probability of the vulnerability being exploited\nin the wild. There are no field- or industry-wide gains to be\nmade via the public disclosure and discussion of the vulner-\nability, e.g., the public disclosure of the vulnerability would\nnot teach the field any new lessons about computer security\nand medical devices.\nThe Choice. For this scenario, a disclosure to some suffi-\nciently large group (e.g., all healthcare professionals who\nwork with the relevant medical condition) would eventually\nresult in a disclosure to the public (through information leak-\nage). Hence, the researchers must choose between not disclos-\ning the vulnerability to anyone or disclosing the vulnerability\nto the government, the healthcare industry, and the public.\nIf the researchers disclose the vulnerability to the public,\nthen patients may be harmed psychologically (a fear of having\na vulnerable / imperfect device even if the likelihood of it be-\ning compromised is zero) or physically (the device increases\na person’s life by ten years; if a patient removes or does not\nreceive the device, they would not receive the health benefits).\nIf the researchers do not disclose the vulnerability to any-\none, then patients do not have the option to make an informed\nchoice with respect to whether they keep the device or, for\nnew patients, whether or not they receive the device.\nOn this Scenario. In 2008, one of us (T.K.) co-authored\na study that discovered and reported on vulnerabilities in a\nwireless implantable medical device [26]. We thought deeply\nabout ethics and responsible disclosure at the time of that\nstudy, and the medical device security field has continued\nto reflect upon ethics and responsible disclosure thereafter,\ne.g., [35, 46]. We designed Scenario A to center patient-\nfocused elements of consideration: the fundamental rights\nthat patients have and the benefits and harms to patients with\neither disclosing or not disclosing a vulnerability. To center\nthe ethical considerations on the patients, in Scenario A it is\nnot possible to update the software on the medical device, and\nhence a traditional coordinated disclosure process of first noti-\nfying the manufacturer and then giving them time to respond\nis not an option (a situation which, unfortunately, is plausi-\nble [49]). Additionally, the healthcare industry has already\ninternalized the importance of computer security for wireless\nimplantable medical devices, e.g., [15, 55], and hence there\nare no significant field-wide positive impacts with a public\ndisclosure. To meet our scenario design criteria, this scenario\n5150    32nd USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Associationpresents only two options to the researchers. In a real-world\nscenario, we anticipate much greater involvement from orga-\nnizations like the U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA); the\nresearchers might even cede the final decision to the FDA or\nanother entity such as U.S. CERT. Additionally, factors such\nas FDA policy might impact the plausibility of Scenario A.\n3.3 Scenario B: Studying Stolen Data\nScenario B centers researchers who are trying to decide\nwhether or not to study stolen data.\nContext. Company B offers a service that matches job ap-\nplicants with jobs. The public believes that Company B’s AI\nmatching system has racial and gender biases. Some people\nalso believe that Company B’s AI system could be manipu-\nlated by adversaries. Adversaries compromise Company B’s\nservers and steal the entirety of their data, including all data\nabout all past job postings, all past job application packets,\nand the outputs of all past job-applicant matches from Com-\npany B’s AI system. The adversaries also steal all internal\ndetails of Company B’s AI matching system, including the\nunderlying ML model. The thieves post the stolen material\nonline; a research group obtains a copy of the stolen mate-\nrial as soon as it is publicly available. Subsequently, many\nvictims of the data breach — the job applicants — publicly\nstate their desire for the stolen data to be permanently deleted,\neverywhere; all publicly-available copies are then deleted.\nThe Choice. The research group wishes to study the stolen\ndata and scientifically assess whether Company B’s AI match-\ning system is, in fact, biased. If it is biased, the researchers\nseek to measure past impacts of those biases, e.g., by counting\nthe number of applicants not forwarded to employers because\nof racial or gender biases. Additionally, using the stolen data —\nincluding both the ML model and knowledge of the contents\nof past application packets — the researchers hope to assess\nthe vulnerability of Company B’s AI system to adversarial\nmanipulation. Informed by a scientific understanding of the\nbiases and vulnerabilities in Company B’s AI system, the re-\nsearchers intend to propose technical and policy mechanisms\nto mitigate such biases and vulnerabilities in the future.\nThe researchers know, however, that the data was stolen and\nshared publicly over the objections of many job applicants.\nThe researchers must choose between doing nothing (not\nstudying the data) or studying the data and reporting on the\nresults. If the researchers study the data and report on their\nresults, they know not to include anything in their publication\nthat could lead to the identification of any of the job applicants.\nIf they study the data, they also know that they must continue\nto retain a copy of the data even after publishing their results\nin case their results are challenged, e.g., by Company B.\nOn this Scenario. Adjacent to the computer security research\nfield, the human-computer interaction field has an extensive\nhistory of considering the morality of studying data that peo-ple might have technically made public but that they might\nnot wish to be used in research or that might cause harms\nif quoted in a publication, e.g., [9, 17, 18, 39, 43, 60]. These\nworks also consider best practices for how to study such data\nand how to report on the results.\nWithin the security research community, it is not uncom-\nmon to study datasets containing information that users did\nnot intend to be public. A typical example is the study of\nthe contents of stolen password or other databases [52]. An\nadjacent example is the study of anonymized datasets that\nare, in actuality, not fully anonymized, e.g., [2, 40, 51]. The\nubiquity of such studies speaks to at least partial agreement\nwithin the community on the morality of such studies in gen-\neral, though researchers must still pay attention to details. For\nexample, even if researchers study the contents of a leaked\npassword database, they might not include real username and\npassword pairs in a resulting publications, similar to how\nhuman-computer interaction researchers might not include\nfull quotes in publications even if quoting from public data,\ne.g., [5, 9, 18, 39].\nFor Scenario B, we sought a scenario related to stolen data\nbut with content that, by itself, is more sensitive than user-\nnames and passwords. Motivated in part by past computer\nsecurity research on biases and vulnerabilities in remote proc-\ntoring software [10] as well past concerns about biases in\njob-applicant matching systems, e.g., [58], we chose to focus\non an AI job-applicant matching system: a system for which\njob applicants might submit an extensive amount of private\ninformation.\nAs with all our scenarios, our goals in Section 3.1 influ-\nenced our scenario design. Here we highlight two aspects of\nthis scenario that enable it to meet our “decisive” goal. First,\nwhile one might argue that people’s right to privacy extends\nto data that they intended to be private even after others (ille-\ngally) made the data public, we make the right to privacy in\nScenario B even more definitive by having those impacted by\nthe data leak explicitly request that all copies of the data be\ndeleted. Second, if biases are present in the AI system, and\nif those biases are removed, that would change which appli-\ncants are shown to employers. Although preferable in terms\nof overall fairness, such a change could also do harm, e.g.,\nto the removed applicants. To simplify our consequentialist\nanalyses, we explicitly assume that anyone removed through\nthis process would still be able to find a job that they desire.\n3.4 Scenario C: Inadvertent “Disclosure”\nScenario C features an ethical dilemma for a conference pro-\ngram committee member. We selected this scenario to be\namong the three featured because questions of ethics and\nmorality arise not only in research (Scenarios A and B), but\nalso during the peer review process (this scenario).\nContext. A program committee member works for Company\nC and, as part of the program committee process, encounters a\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    5151confidential paper submission detailing an undisclosed vulner-\nability in Company C’s product. Upon reading the submission,\nthe Company C employee realizes that the vulnerability is\nvery serious and that it will take a significant amount of time\nto patch. The employee feels an obligation to their employer\nand to Company C’s users. But, the program chairs required\nall committee members to explicitly agree to maintain the\nconfidentiality of all submissions. Company C’s leadership\nteam decided that the Company C employee should agree to\nthe confidentiality condition and join the program committee.\nThe Choice. The employee of Company C must decide be-\ntween doing nothing (not disclosing the vulnerability in the\npaper to Company C) or disclosing the vulnerability to their\nemployer.\nOn this Scenario. While we are aware of real-world scenar-\nios similar to Scenario C, we are unaware of written public\nstatements about those situations and consequently include\nno background citations. Scenario C is thus based solely on\nthe memories and experiences of the computer security re-\nsearchers on this team as well as discussions with others. As\nwith our other scenarios, the real world is more complex, with\nadditional options available to the program committee mem-\nber, e.g., the program committee member could work with\nthe program chairs to determine a course of action.\n4 Ethical Frameworks\nEthical frameworks define approaches for reasoning about\nwhether actions are morally right or wrong. In ethics / moral\nphilosophy, the oft-cited three main ethical frameworks are\nconsequentialist ethics, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics.\nA fourth oft-discussed framework is discourse ethics. We\ndiscuss the first two in Section 4.1. Although our analyses\nfocus on the first two, we discuss the latter two along with\nseveral other frameworks, including principlism (featured in\nthe Belmont and Menlo Reports [54, 56]) in Section 4.2.\nThe frameworks we explore have in some cases evolved\nover considerable periods of time, with a multitude of con-\ntributions, objections, and adaptations. There can thus exist\na vast variety of different branches and nuances within each\nframework. Since our goal is to explore moral dilemmas in\ncomputer security research from the perspective of different\nethical frameworks and not to argue, for example, the benefits\nof one framework over another or for a new theory of ethics\nfor computer security research, we limit our descriptions to\nthe general features of each framework. Our summaries are\nsufficient to clearly contrast the different frameworks with\neach other and to receive clearly distinguishable reasonings\nand outcomes with regard to our scenarios from Section 3.\nWhile we believe that our summaries are sufficient to en-\nable security researchers to explore their own problems with\nthese frameworks, we defer interested readers to works such\nas Anscombe’s article “Modern Moral Philosophy” [4], Bag-gini and Fosl’s book The Ethics Toolkit [6], Deigh’s book An\nIntroduction to Ethics [14], Driver’s book Ethics: The Funda-\nmentals [16], and Stanford University’s online resources [48]\nfor additional, general information. For works focused on\nethics and technology / engineering, we defer readers to works\nsuch as Floridi’s book The Cambridge Handbook of Informa-\ntion and Computer Ethics [19], Iphofen’s book Handbook of\nResearch Ethics and Scientific Integrity [32], Quinn’s book\nEthics for the Information Age [45], and Santa Clara Univer-\nsity’s online resources [57], as well as professional codes of\nethics [1, 31, 41]. Further, as we stress elsewhere, we are not\narguing for the application of any of the frameworks we sur-\nvey; rather, we are arguing for the use of these frameworks as\nmechanisms to facilitate thoughtful dialog and inquiry while,\nfor example, applying the principles in the Menlo Report [56].\n4.1 Consequentialist and Deontological Ethics\nAs discussed earlier, we center consequentialist and deonto-\nlogical ethics in our analyses because of their prominence in\nthe field of ethics / moral philosophy and because of their\nexisting role in the computer security research community,\ne.g., their presence in the Menlo Report [56].\nConsequentialist Ethics. Consequentialism centers the con-\nsequences — the outcomes — of an action, both positive\n(benefits) and negative (harms). Each consequentialism com-\nprises of a value theory (e.g., hedonism) and a moral principle\n(e.g., maximizing overall utility), according to which an ac-\ntion is morally right exactly when there is no other action\nwith better consequences as measured by the respective value\ntheory.\nUtilitarianism is an example of consequentialism in which\npositive and negative outcomes are generally assessed with\nrespect to the well-being (welfare) of people. We use utilitar-\nianism in the consequentialist analyses in this paper. Under\nutilitarianism, the right action is the action that produces the\ngreatest net positive well-being. There are three main cate-\ngories of utilitarianism,6each corresponding to one of three\nmain theories of well-being:\n•Hedonic utilitarianism: An action is right if it produces\nthe greatest net happiness — the greatest aggregate hap-\npiness over a given set of individuals [50].\n•Preference utilitarianism: An action is right if it en-\nables the greatest number of people to live by their own\npreferences [27].\n•Objective list utilitarianism: An action is right if it\nproduces the greatest net positive impacts on the greatest\nnumber of people with respect to an objective list of\nmeasures [42]; example measures are the levels of one’s\nhealth, wealth, or access to resources.\n6For the purposes of this paper and the decisions in the scenarios, we\nfocus on direct action utilitarianism and ignore rule utilitarianism.\n5152    32nd USENIX Security Symposium USENIX AssociationFor objective list utilitarianism, the standards to maximize\nfor are not subjective desires or preferences, but rather “ob-\njective” (in the sense of “applicable to all”) measures such\nas level of health, wealth, and safety (happiness could also\nbe one standard on the list, though some argue that happiness\ncannot be objectively measured).\nThese categories are related but distinct. For example, in-\ncreased health (an objective list measure) can lead to increased\nhappiness (the hedonic measure). Likewise, if someone can\nlive by their preference (preference), then they may be more\nlikely to be happy (hedonic). On the other hand, and as a\nsecurity-related example, people might prefer to create short\npasswords or not waste time waiting for software updates to\ncomplete (preference), but the use of short passwords and\ndeclining software updates could make people’s computer\nsystems less secure (an objective list measure).\nRather than rely solely on a single definition of well-being\nand hence a single category of utilitarianism, those evaluating\nmorality of actions may employ:\n•Pluralistic utilitarianism: Pluralistic utilitarianism con-\nsiders happiness, preference, objective lists, and other\nforms of benefits / harms in combination.\nIn moral considerations, a central focus is on the question,\n“what is the right decision to make?” However, the question\n“did we make the right decision?” is equally important, as it\ndeals with questions of (retrospective) responsibility, redress,\nand retributive justice. When evaluating the moral quality of\nan action that has already happened, one view of consequen-\ntialism focuses on the actual outcomes regardless of what the\nlikely outcomes were prior to the action. A probabilistic view\nof consequentialism asks whether the action was likely to\nhave produced a net positive outcome regardless of whether it\nactually did so. Under the former view, an action that would\nlikely have produced net negative results but that did not is\nstill a right action; under the latter view, the action is not right.\nRelatedly, when considering what decision to make, direct\naction utilitarianism focuses on the outcome of an action.\nRule utilitarianism focuses on whether the decision follows\nrules designed to maximize positive net outcomes. Under rule\nutilitarianism, an action that causes net harm is still right if it\nfollows rules that, across all scenarios, produce the greatest\nnet positive results. We designed the scenarios in Section 3\nto highlight key points of consideration about benefits and\nharms in individual situations and not as vehicles to discuss\ngeneralizable rules for the field. Hence, in Section 5, we adopt\na direct action utilitarian perspective.\nDeontological Ethics. Deontological ethics focuses on the\nmoral duties of a given moral actor, such as an individual or\nan institution. These duties are often specified as direct duties\n(obligations) against others7— i.e., what does one person\n7This is one aspect that differentiates deontological reasoning from con-\nsequentialism, which at most posits a general duty to be moral (i.e., produce\nthe best outcomes).(morally) owe others [33]? These duties are often specified in\nterms of justice, either as negative duties (refrain from doing\nharm)8or as positive duties to certain claims that others have.\nIn modern rights-based theories, these duties correspond to\n(moral) rights of the moral patient to whom the duty is owed.\nFor example, if one person has a right to privacy, others owe\nthis person (the moral patient) a certain behavior associated\nwith that right.9\nA defining result of the duty- / rights-based approach of\ndeontological ethics is the focus on the right intention to\nact. While consequentialist ethics are mainly concerned with\nthe outcomes, deontological ethics ask whether the action\nis undertaken out of a consideration for one’s moral duty,\nor by some other thought process. Only an action that is\nperformed with the intention to discharge a moral duty is\nconsidered moral.10Kant as one of the main protagonists\nof deontological ethics distinguishes between acting morally\n(i.e., out of consideration for one’s moral duty) and legally\n(e.g., out of consideration for an actual legal framework or\nout of fear of sanctions). For example, completing a human\nsubjects review process, such as an IRB within the U.S., solely\nbecause it is a university requirement is not a moral act.\nDeontological ethics differ widely in their justification of\nthe respective duties. One historical example is Divine Com-\nmand and the duty to fulfill God’s will. Most famously, Kan-\ntian ethics derives the moral duties from the faculty of reason\nthat human beings have: because we can reason about what to\ndo and thus control our desires, we have the obligation to do\nso in order to become autonomous (giving ourselves the moral\nlaw). And, since we are all potentially autonomous, we have a\nduty to treat all other human beings as such, i.e., as “ends and\nnever purely as means” in Kant’s words. A modern version of\nthis Kantian thought is a specific take on contractualism [47],\nwhich posits that we should act in a way that cannot be rea-\nsonably rejected by anyone. Natural rights theories, on the\nother hand, take the idea that human beings as moral actors\nhave certain faculties and justify natural (i.e., unalienable)\nrights (and corresponding duties) from those faculties for all\npersons (e.g., John Locke’s “life, liberty, and estate” or the\nVirginia Bill of Rights) [37].\nGiven the influence of Kantian deontological ethics on\n8While consequentialism is also concerned about (overall) harm, it does\nnot hold that there are specific duties to the single individuals not to harm\nthem. Rather, it aggregates harms and benefits, such that one given individual\nmight suffer considerable harm if the net benefit for others is positive.\n9These rights are often spelled out in Hohfeldian claim rights and cor-\nresponding obligations. As in our scenarios, the moral agents (researchers,\nprogram committee members, and so on) may incur direct moral obligations,\nHohfeld’s distinction between claim rights and liberty rights is not important\nhere.\n10This is not to say that deontological ethics entirely disregards the out-\ncomes of an action. Neo-Kantian versions like John Rawls’ “difference\nprinciple” (unequal distribution of certain goods is just, as long as it also ben-\nefits the least well-off), for example, often add a consequentialist aspect to the\notherwise deontological reasoning. However, also in these cases the primary\nfactor is individual rights and the intention to discharge duties associated\nwith these rights.\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    5153the Belmont Report [54] and the Principles of Biomedical\nEthics [7], and hence on the Menlo Report [56] and (some-\ntimes implicit) arguments within the computer security re-\nsearch community, we take a Kantian approach to our ethics\nanalyses. In order to make deontological ethics more tangible\nfor computer security ethics and to contrast it more sharply\nwith consequentialist ethics, in this paper we make a some-\nwhat simplified assumption that deontological ethics conducts\nmoral evaluation in the form of (individual or collective) du-\nties and corresponding (individual) rights, that are spelled out\nin (absolute) terms of right or wrong. For example, if it is a\nduty not to harm someone, then killing one person to save five\nother lives — as presented in the classical trolley problem —\ndirectly interferes with this duty (and the person’s right not to\nbe killed) and is therefore wrong, no matter what.11\nIn contrast, consequentialist ethics, as exemplified by utili-\ntarianism, conducts moral evaluation in the form of overall\nwell-being (net utility), which allows comparative evaluations.\nThe state in which only one person is dead will thus typically\nbe a better state than the state in which five people are dead.\nWhile deontological ethics focuses on the intention (to dis-\ncharge one’s moral duties and to honor the rights of others to\nbe treated in a certain way), consequentialist ethics focuses\non the outcome of an action, policy, social practice, and more.\n4.2 Other Ethical Frameworks\nWhile there are other ethical frameworks, for the purpose of\nthis paper we focus on consequentialist and deontological\naccounts (Section 4.1). These frameworks already have a\nstrong presence within the security community, e.g., in the\nMenlo Report [56]. Indeed, elements of these frameworks\nare (at least implicitly) present whenever a researcher weighs\nbenefits and harms or considers human rights. By construction\n(Section 3.1), these are also not only the easiest frameworks to\napply in the scenarios we present, but also contrast each other\n(at least in the simplified scenarios that we have established).\nNonetheless, we wanted to give a brief overview of some\nother ethical frameworks that seek to answer the question:\nWhat does it mean to act morally?\nVirtue Ethics. Virtue ethics focuses more on how actors\nshould be, i.e., a (morally) virtuous person, than on how they\nshould act, since from being a virtuous person, (morally)\nvirtuous actions will follow. In the Western world, the virtue\nethical tradition can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle, who\nargued that people should cultivate and internalize virtuous\nmoral character traits. Once internalized, a virtuous person\nwould act virtuously — would choose the right action — by\nhabit and by instinct. While “by habit and by instinct” at least\nfor some authors necessitates immediacy, virtuous persons\n11Of course, there are also pro-tanto-duties, which only hold as long as\nno more important or pressing duty surfaces. In order to contrast the two\ntraditions more sharply, however, we ignore these in this paper.will still often use practical wisdom (“phronesis”) in order\nto assess new situations and how they relate to internalized\nvirtues. As this practical wisdom is itself a virtue, employing\nit in the right fashion and right instances also shows a virtu-\nous person. While (in this Aristotelian sense) truly virtuous\npersons act on their internalized moral dispositions, they may\nalso take time to thoughtfully consider the available actions,\nthe expected outcomes, their responsibilities, and more, before\ndeciding upon which action to take. Elements of virtue ethics\nmanifests in the security community, for example, through\nthe internalization of approaches to ethics after repeatedly\nconsidering ethics and security research over time, or when-\never a program committee asks the question, “did the authors\nrealize that they might have caused harm?”\nWhile much of ethics / moral philosophy centers West-\nern history, the internalization of virtuous character traits is\npresent in numerous other traditions around the world, such\nas the yamas (external ethical practices) and niyamas (internal\nethical practices) of the eight-fold Yogic traditions and the\nstriving for mushin (an empty mind without motives or ego)\nin Japanese tradition. Likewise, and relatedly, Buddhist ethics\nand Confucian ethics also center virtues [44].\nDiscourse Ethics. Unlike consequentialist, deontological, and\nvirtue ethics, which focus on the actions or actors, discourse\nethics center a process for moral decision making, namely an\nidealized moral discourse that is egalitarian, inclusive, and\nprincipally interminable. Under discourse ethics, the belief\nis that whenever this idealized moral discourse nears a con-\nsensus, then this consensus is as close as we will ever get\nto moral truth. Discourse ethics provides a process for deter-\nmining the morally right action even when, a priori , there is\ndisagreement in what is morally right. In order to make this\nframework operationalizable, a key consideration has to be\nhow to transform this justificatory claim about moral truth\nin a principally boundless moral community into the moral\nstatus of a real discourse within the computer security com-\nmunity. Another question is what constitutes “idealized moral\ndiscourse’ within the realm of computer security. For exam-\nple, could discussions within ethics review committees be\nregarded as an — albeit very specific and expert — idealized\nmoral discourse?\nPrinciplism Ethics. Principlism ethics believes that there are\nrelatively uncontroversial principles upon which most moral\ntheories converge, i.e., that there are a few principles central to\nthe other frameworks combined. These principles should be\nused as a starting point to assess the morality of actions, insti-\ntutions, policies, and more. One example is the four principles\nof biomedical ethics from Beauchamp and Childress [7]: re-\nspect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.\nAlso published in the same era (1970s) are the principles in\nthe Belmont Report [54], which focuses on the protection\nof human subjects in research. The Belmont principles are:\nrespect for persons, beneficence, and justice.\n5154    32nd USENIX Security Symposium USENIX AssociationThe Belmont [54] and the Beauchamp and Childress [7]\nprinciples derive from both consequentialist and deontologi-\ncal ethics. Under principlism ethics, when faced with a moral\ndecision, the actors should evaluate their courses of action\nwith respect to these identified, universal principles. When\nconflicts arise between the application of different princi-\nples, e.g., between a consequentialist-derived principle and\na deontological-derived principle, a process must be used to\nresolve those conflicts. The Menlo Report articulates the ap-\nplication of the Belmont Report’s principles to the computing\nresearch field [56]. To make use of principlism for computer\nsecurity scenarios, one must specify these principles at a con-\ncrete level and also formulate rules of priority in cases of\nvalue conflicts.\nEmancipatory Ethics. Emancipatory ethics is the kind of\nethics that Critical Theory would call its own, if Critical The-\nory entertained a dedicated ethics.12This kind of ethics is\nour umbrella term for more specific ethical enterprises, such\nas Ideology Critique, or certain versions of Care Ethics and\nFeminist Ethics. Common to all of these is the focus on the\nself-emancipation of individuals or groups that are in some\nway oppressed or marginalized. In order to achieve this out-\ncome, emancipatory ethics centers the emancipated life — a\nlife in which everyone can know and pursue their own “true\ninterests” [23]. Emancipatory ethics therefore does not pro-\nvide a framework to distinguish (moral) right from wrong,\nand not even an account of the conditions necessary such that\nthose affected may be able to do so themselves. Rather, it\ncriticizes current conditions as detrimental to a self-reflection\non the affected’s “true interest” and the individual and so-\ncial transformations necessary to realize these interests [28].\nMore concretely, it analyzes social structures and relations\nin order to uncover and understand inequities, power struc-\ntures, oppression, and discrimination, which will prevent those\naffected by these structures to “truly” self-reflect on their in-\nterests and associated moral obligations and to express them\nfreely [30]. Under emancipatory ethics, there is no right moral\naction. Rather, it points to inequities, power structures, op-\npression, and more, not because of them being morally wrong,\nbut because they inhibit the reflective moral process of those\naffected by those structures. Moreover, the belief is that those\nin power are often as tied by these structures as the oppressed,\nbut with more to lose. Hence, under emancipatory ethics, it is\nessential to (1) highlight the results of the above-mentioned\nanalyses and (2) thereby enable those subjected to these power\nasymmetries to contest them and demand change. An example\nof (2) would be including those with less power in the process\nof determining what is right, or inviting them to lead that pro-\ncess. As another example of the application of emancipatory\nethics, if consequentialist- or deontological-like analyses are\n12The reluctance of many proponents of Critical Theory to talk about\nethics or “an” ethics is often due to the perceived function of ethics to “tell\nothers what is right or wrong”. This goes directly against the emancipatory\nendeavor of Critical Theory to further “true” (ethical) self-reflection [29].performed, then inequities, power structures, oppression, and\ndiscrimination must be considered centrally.\n5 Analysis of Scenarios A, B, and C\nWe now turn to using consequentialist and deontological\nethics (Section 4) to analyze the scenarios in Section 3. We\nencourage readers to review Scenarios A, B, and C first and\nconsider what decisions they would make before reading\nour analyses. If readers wish, they may complete an online\nGoogle Form with their decisions (link available at https:\n//securityethics.cs.washington.edu ) and, upon doing\nso, see how others chose to respond.13\n5.1 Analysis of Scenario A (Medical Device\nVulnerability)\nHere we consider the medical device vulnerability scenario\nfrom Section 3.2.\nConsequentialist Ethics. Physical health in this scenario is\nan objective measure; if a patient chooses to remove a device\nor chooses not to obtain one because of a known vulnerability,\nthen they would have a shorter life expectancy. Psychological\nhealth in this scenario is also an objective measure; if a patient\nknows about the vulnerability and still chooses to keep or get\nthe implant, then they could live in fear of a security incident\neven though the likelihood of an incident is zero (by scenario\nconstruction).14\nFrom a hedonic perspective, the knowledge that one has a\nshorter life expectancy (if they do not have the device) or the\nfear of a security incident (if they have the device) could lead\nto decreased happiness. In addition, the fact that removing\nor not opting for the device will result in ten years less of\npotential happiness may also significantly decrease overall\nhappiness. From a preference utilitarian perspective, under the\nassumption that most patients would prefer not to learn about\nthe vulnerability, then not disclosing the vulnerability would\nmaximize the ability of people to live by their preference.\nHence, the morally correct decision is to not disclose the\nvulnerability .\nDeontological Ethics. Under deontological ethics, the re-\nsearchers have a duty to respect people’s right to informed\nconsent and the right to self-agency. In the medical context,\nthis right to informed consent manifests (for example) as\nwarnings in TV advertisements for medicines. These are fun-\ndamental human rights, and not disclosing the vulnerability\n13The Google Form is anonymous — it requires Google authentication but\ndoes not reveal any identifiers to the authors of this paper. When interpreting\nthe results of this form, we caution that no mechanisms, other than Google\nauthentication, are used to protect against the use of different Google accounts\nto vote multiple times.\n14In the real world, decision-makers must also consider family members,\nloved ones, and other stakeholders; we focus on patients for expositional\nsimplicity.\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    5155would violate those rights. Hence, the morally correct deci-\nsion is to disclose the vulnerability . This conclusion is correct\neven if most people would have preferred not to know about\nthe vulnerability.\nInformed by the Real World, Not Real. As discussed in\nSection 3, although real-world observations and experiences\ninformed our scenario designs, there are gaps between our\nscenarios and what one might encounter in the real-world.\nRather than choose from one of only two provided (binary)\noptions, the researchers might, for example, choose to involve\nothers in the decision-making process or cede the decision re-\nsponsibility to another entity entirely. In the U.S., the FDA —\nnot the researchers — could make or strongly contribute to\nthe decision on whether to disclose the vulnerability to the\npublic. Should they choose to disclose the vulnerability, they\nmight work with healthcare providers to thoughtfully and con-\nscientiously craft the message, thereby reducing patient alarm.\nGiven the medical and security contexts, the decision-makers\nmight leverage the Principles of Biomedical Ethics [7] and the\nMenlo Report [56]. Thus, even if the decision-makers do not\nsolely rely on consequentialist or deontological analyses, and\nindeed consequentialist and deontological ethics both have\nlimitations, consequentialist and deontological thinking may\nbe part of the final decision-making process.\nIn Scenario A, we made the assumption that there is zero\nlikelihood of the vulnerability being exploited regardless of\nwhether or not the vulnerability is made public. We could have\ninstead provided probability distributions for the likelihood\nof exploitation both if the vulnerability is made public and\nif it is not and then, for our consequentialist analysis, we\ncould have calculated the likely overall benefits and harms for\neach decision. From a deontological perspective, if the public\nvulnerability disclosure would result in more people’s devices\nbeing compromised than would be the case if there was not a\npublic disclosure, then we would need to consider the negative\nimpact of the public disclosure on those people’s rights. By\nfixing the exploit probability at zero, our work is able to focus\non comparing and contrasting the different ethical traditions\nrather than providing lengthy empirical analyses.\nThe above discussion points to another challenge with eth-\nical decision making in the real world: uncertainty. In the\nreal-world, a decision-maker might encounter questions that\nthey cannot precisely answer, such as: Do all potential ad-\nversaries already know about the vulnerability? If not, then\nthe public disclosure of the vulnerability might increase the\nexploit probability. On the other hand, if so, then the public\ndisclosure of the vulnerability might not increase the exploit\nprobability. That is unless, for example, the public disclosure\nof the vulnerability results in adversaries being more comfort-\nable using their knowledge of the vulnerability. Would they\nbe more comfortable? Or, supposing that adversaries do not\nalready know about the vulnerability, what is the likelihood\nthat they might discover the vulnerability themselves?5.2 Analysis of Scenario B (Studying Im-\nmorally Obtained Data)\nWe now turn to analyzing the scenario in Section 3.3.\nConsequentialist Ethics. Being able to find a job that one\nis qualified for is an objective measure of well-being in this\nscenario. The research has the potential to uncover biases or\nattack capabilities that can limit people’s ability to find jobs.\nBy proposing mechanisms to mitigate these biases or vulnera-\nbilities, the research output can improve the ability of people\nto find such jobs.15Thus, from an objective list utilitarian\nperspective, the benefits of studying the data is high. Further,\nthe data is already “public” and hence harm to job applicants\nhas already happened. Further, the number of people harmed\nby the theft and release of the data is comparatively small\ncompared to the one hundred-fold prediction of future use.\nThus, from an objective list utilitarian perspective, the morally\ncorrect decision is to study the data.\nA hedonic or preference utilitarianist would, respectively,\nobserve that analyzing the data could degrade the happiness\nof the people whose data was stolen and would also prevent\nthem to live by their preference, if they would prefer that\nthe data not be studied. However, the number of people who\nwould benefit (in both happiness and the ability to live by\ntheir own preferences) after the data is studied is far greater.\nHence, even with the hedonic and preference utilitarianist\nframeworks, the morally correct decision is to study the data.\nDeontological Ethics. Taking a Kantian deontological view,\nwe observe that people have inalienable rights, including\nagency and privacy. Those rights extend to data intended\nto be private, whether it is private or not. Further, even if the\nright to privacy did not extend to adversarially-released data\nafter it becomes public, in this scenario, the victims of the data\nbreach have explicitly requested that their data be deleted ev-\nerywhere. In order to do their research, the researchers would\nneed to retain a copy of the data, thereby disrespecting the\nrequest to delete all data copies. They would also need to\nretain a copy after their research is complete in case their\nresults are challenged, e.g., by Company B.\nOne might observe that future job applicants have a right\nto be treated fairly during the job application process, that\nthe research results could result in a more fair AI system,\nand hence ultimately that the research would result in greater\nrespect for the rights of future job applicants. However, under\nKantian deontological ethics, individuals enjoy dignity. In\nKant’s own terms, this means that individuals may not only\nbe treated as a means, but also always as an end in itself .\nViolating privacy rights in order to study the data (and prevent\nfuture harm) amounts to treating those whose data is studied\nsolely as means to a different end, and is therefore wrong.\n15Recall from Section 3.3 that addressing biases will improve the ability\nof some people to find a job (those impacted by biases) but, to simplify the\nanalysis, will not negatively impact the ability of other people to find a job.\n5156    32nd USENIX Security Symposium USENIX AssociationOne might ask whether it would be appropriate to contact\nvictims of the data breach and ask if their data can be re-\ntained and used for research — i.e., to obtain those victims’\ninformed consent. This scenario does not present that option\nto the researchers. However, even if it did, under a deontologi-\ncal perspective, the act of asking a victim for informed consent\nin this scenario requires using the stolen data (to obtain vic-\ntim identity or contact information); using the stolen data in\nthis way is already a violation of privacy. Further, the act of\ncontacting the victims could have unknown consequences.\nTherefore, under Kantian deontological ethics, the stolen\ndata should not be studied .\nInformed by the Real World, Not Real. As with Scenario A,\nthis scenario is informed by real-world experiences and ob-\nservations but is not real. Researchers in the real world might\nhave a mandatory first step prior to analyzing the data, e.g., if\nthe researchers are in the U.S., they should work with their\ninstitution’s IRB. The IRB would leverage the principles in\nthe Belmont Report [54], which itself includes both conse-\nquentialist and deontological reasoning. The researchers may\nalso seek input from others. For example, they may seek in-\nput from AI and security ethics experts, who might then also\nreference consequentialist, deontological, and other ethical\nframeworks. The researchers might also seek input from pop-\nulations impacted by the study or non-study of the data, in-\ncluding representatives of people impacted by the data breach\nand representatives of people who could be harmed by the\nperpetuation of biases in Company B’s AI system. Moreover,\nthe researchers might offer these groups the option to lead the\ndecision on whether to study the data.\n5.3 Analysis of Scenario C (Inadvertent Data\n“Disclosure”)\nWe now turn to the scenario in Section 3.4.\nConsequentialist Ethics. The consequentialist must weight\nharms against benefits. There are harms to authors if the\nemployee of Company C discloses the vulnerability to Com-\npany C — the authors will not be able to disclose at their pre-\nferred time (perference utilitarianism) and may be unhappy\n(hedonic utilitarianism) and may have their careers or other\naspects of their lives negatively impacted if the early disclo-\nsure to Company C limits their impact or ability to publish\n(career advancement could be a measure of well-being per\nobjective list utilitarianism).\nHowever, the harms to Company C’s users if the employee\ndoes not disclose the vulnerability to Company C is much\ngreater — without early disclosure, Company C will not be\nable to protect their users and, as a result, millions of people\naround the world could be significantly harmed.\nHence, the morally correct action is for the employee to\ndisclose the vulnerability internally to Company C.Deontological Ethics. The employee of Company C may feel\na sense of duty to their company and to their company’s users.\nHowever, program committee members also have a duty to\nrespect the autonomy of authors and a duty to respect the\nconfidentiality of the peer review process. Moreover, the em-\nployee of Company C agreed to respect this duty when they\njoined the program committee, as did Company C’s leader-\nship team when they granted the employee permission to join\nthe program committee. Moreover, from a Kantian reasoning,\nthe employee could not form a maxim that allowed breaking\nthe confidentiality promise, as otherwise the peer review pro-\ncess and the institution of program committees would not be\npossible.\nThus, the morally correct thing for the Company C em-\nployee to do is respect the rights of the authors and the confi-\ndenitality of the review process and not disclose the vulnera-\nbility to Company C.\nInformed by the Real World, Not Real. In a real-world\nscenario, the employee of Company C might not make the de-\ncision on their own. For example, rather than decide between\nthe two options we presented, they might first reach out to\nthe program chairs and ask them to give advice or render a\ndecision. The program chairs might then explore questions\nsuch as: should they reach out to the paper’s authors, asking\nfor more information about the disclosure timeline? If Com-\npany C’s employee assesses the harms of the vulnerability\nas significant, should the program chairs ask the authors to\ndisclose to Company C right away? What are the impacts on\nthe scientific peer review process if the program chairs ask\nthe authors to disclose to Company C? Would the authors\nfeel compelled to grant permission because they want their\npaper to be accepted even if granting permission is not in\ntheir best interest? Since not all companies have members on\nthe program committee, is it morally right to give this com-\npany (and their users) advance notice of a vulnerability (even\nwith author permission) solely because an employee of their\ncompany is on the program committee?\n6 Discussion\n6.1 Reflection on Analyses\nWe begin by reflecting upon our analyses and summarizing\nkey points and observations. We are not claiming that all these\nreflections and observations are novel and, indeed, many ideas\nherein are likely familiar to those with expertise in ethics; see\nSection 4 for a survey of resources on ethics / moral philoso-\nphy. We offer these reflections and observations because we\nhope that they can serve to further our community’s collective\nthoughts and perspectives on ethics and computer security.\nDifferent Frameworks Can Lead to Different Conclusions.\nFor some moral questions, different ethical frameworks lead\ntodifferent conclusions regarding what is right and wrong.\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    5157Different Frameworks Can Lead to the Same Conclusion.\nFor other moral questions, different ethical frameworks lead\nto the same conclusion regarding what is right and wrong.\nA Framework Can Fail to Reach a Conclusion. We inten-\ntionally designed our scenarios to be “decisive”, per the goals\nin Section 3.1; real-world scenarios may notbe decisive and\nmay notlead to conclusive decisions under either the con-\nsequentialist or deontological frameworks. Also, it could be\nthe case that under a framework a certain action is morally\npermitted, i.e., not necessarily required but also not forbidden.\nEthical Frameworks Can Provide Tools for Discussion.\nWhat should one do when there are differences of opinion\nor lack of clarity into what constitutes the right decision?\nHere is where the tools — the frameworks — from ethics /\nmoral philosophy can help. In short, they can help decision-\nmakers thoughtfully, methodically, and articulately analyze\nmoral questions.\nIn discussions of right or wrong, when there is disagree-\nment, we suggest first surfacing the communicants’ under-\nlying values and their frameworks of consideration. Simply\nknowing that another communicant is centering different val-\nues and a different framework may help further a collaborative\ndiscussion.\nEthical Frameworks Can Provide Tools for Thought. In\nthis work, we primarily consider consequentialist and deonto-\nlogical ethics. Both of these frameworks have limitations, and\nwe are notadvocating for strict adherence to either of them.\nIn fact, it is not uncommon for people — including modern\nethicists — to include elements of multiple frameworks (con-\nsequentialist, deontological, and other) as they reason through\ndecisions. Within the security research community, the Menlo\nReport [56] includes both consequentialist and deontological\nelements, for example.\nOn the one hand, the observation above might call into\nquestion the value of articulating ethical frameworks in the\nfirst place: if people are not strictly consequentialist or deonto-\nlogical, what value is there in exploring scenarios from strict\nconsequentialist or deontological perspectives? We argue that\nprecise analyses of scenarios under different perspectives can\nhelp the decision-maker in multiple ways. At a minimum,\nprecise thinking via the ethical frameworks can help slow the\ndecision-making process and encourage thoughtful reflection\nand contemplation. Additionally, the frameworks can help\ndecision-makers identify which parts of arguments they agree\nwith and which parts they do not and, by doing so, help the\ndecision-maker better articulate their own arguments, even if\ntheir arguments are neither consequentialist nor deontological.\nSometimes the Morally Correct Action is Not in the Best\nInterest of the Decision-Maker. In Scenarios A, B, and C,\nwe tried to minimize the impact of either decision on the\ndecision-makers themselves. Thus, the decision-makers could\nfocus on the impacts on and rights of others. In the real world,a decision-maker’s decision might also impact themselves\n(e.g., a researcher might desire a publication, and the decision\non how to proceed might impact their ability to publish). We\nexplore such situations in Scenarios D∗and F in the full\nversion of this paper [34]. In short, sometimes the morally\nright decision might notbe the decision that seems to be in\nthe best interest of the decision-maker.\nShifting Morality Earlier. Our scenarios all feature moral\nquestions for decision-makers. However, one might ask (not\njust for our scenarios, but for the field) how to shift questions\nof morality earlier, such that the scenarios we consider (or the\nreal world encounters) do not come up. In a trolley problem,\nan example of “shifting earlier” might be to ensure that all\ntrolleys have better, more resilient brakes. For Scenario A,\ncode escrow might enable the patching of devices even af-\nter the manufacturer ceases operation. For Scenario B, the\nresearchers would not have needed to study the data if the\nunderlying AI algorithms were already unbiased and secure.\nFor Scenario C, the situation could be mitigated if the con-\nference had pre-specified rules for such situations or if the\nconference required disclosure before submission; of course,\nwhether such a rule should be in place raises its own ethi-\ncal questions, as exhibited (for example) by the role of legal\nthreats in Scenarios D∗in the full version of this paper [34].\nOn Uncertainty. Within the computer security field, there\nare significant elements of uncertainty. One challenging ele-\nment of uncertainty surrounds that of the adversary. It is often\nnot known to decision makers when or if adversaries might\nmanifest. Further, precise adversarial capabilities are seldom\nknown to decision makers in advance of their manifestation.\nAdditionally, there is generally uncertainty regarding what un-\nknown vulnerabilities a system might have. For our core sce-\nnarios, we aimed to reduce uncertainty through the concrete,\nprecise description of outcomes for each decision option. A\nchallenge for the computer security research community, and\nan opportunity for ethics and moral philosophy researchers, is\nto formulate frameworks and candidate approaches for ethical\ndecision making in the presence of uncertainty, including un-\ncertainty about adversaries, adversarial actions, and unknown\nvulnerabilities. (It is because of the challenges imposed by\nuncertainties that we explicitly incorporate uncertainty into\nScenarios D∗in the full version of this paper [34].)\nOn the Role of Details and Time. Ethical assessments not\nonly depend on moral arguments (e.g., whether we should\nmaximize utility understood as X, whether one has a right to\nYor a duty towards person Z), but also on non-moral consid-\nerations about the specifics of a given context. Therefore, it\nis difficult to provide ethically sound judgments that persist\nover time (as the field of computer security evolves and learns\nmore), as well as across the nuances of different scenarios.\nOn the latter, we refer to the D∗and E∗scenario sequences in\nthe full version of this paper [34] and the impacts of scenario\n5158    32nd USENIX Security Symposium USENIX Associationchanges on what one might perceive as morally right or wrong.\nLikewise, one might consider the impact of changes to the\nspecifics of Scenarios A, B, and C, e.g., if impacted job appli-\ncants did not explicitly request the deletion of stolen data in\nScenario B or if the program chairs did not explicitly mandate\nconfidentiality in Scenario C. Further, our field’s understand-\ning of harms and adverse impacts evolve over time, e.g., as the\nfield’s knowledge of adversarial capabilities or the (possibly)\nharmful consequences of a research method matures. Hence,\nwhat might be seen as morally right or permissible at one\npoint in time may, at a later date, be seen as neither morally\nright nor permissible, and vice versa. Collectively, these are\nnotreasons not to strive for detailed, specific rules (or at least\nguidelines) for ethically sound behavior. Rather, we suggest\nthat the specific contexts are among the factors that the secu-\nrity community must consider if it were to do so. We argue\nthat the security community should therefore formulate the\nrules as specific as possible andas general as necessary in\norder to abstract from the details of a given context. A first\nconsideration here could be that (in much the same way as in\nlegal texts) the impartial nature of morality requires the treat-\nment of like cases alike. Therefore, guidelines should address\ntypes of cases, rather than single out individual cases, but\nwith consideration both for when and where generalizability\napplies and when there may be challenges to generalization.\n6.2 For Consideration\nWith the background of our results and our reflections, we\nnow present a collection of considerations for members of the\nsecurity research community.\nFor Decision-Makers. Decision-makers (researchers, pro-\ngram committees, others) should consider ethics before mak-\ning decisions, rather than after. For certain moral dilemmas\n(e.g., Scenarios A, B, and C), it is possible to pick an out-\ncome and then find the ethical framework that justifies that\noutcome. We do notargue for this practice. Instead, decision-\nmakers should let the decision follow from a disinterested\nethical analysis. Toward facilitating disinterested analyses,\nwe encourage decision-makers to explicitly enumerate and\narticulate any interests that they might have in the results of\nthe decision; such an articulation could be included as part of\na positionality statement in a paper.\nFor Researchers Writing Papers. For researchers new to\nethics, the Menlo Report [56] provides concrete guidance.\nThe Menlo Report and other ethical frameworks can help\nresearchers reach a conclusion about what is morally right.\nThis paper, we hope, can help researchers consider and\ndiscuss morality when there are differences of opinion or\nuncertainty regarding what to do. Because (1) we believe\nthat the field can grow through the explicit articulation of\nethical thought and (2) there can be differences in ethical\nperspectives and thought (as Section 5 shows), we encour-age researchers to do more than just apply a single approach\n(consequentialist, deontological, the principles in the Menlo\nReport, or otherwise) and then act accordingly. Rather, we\nencourage researchers to conduct analyses under multiple eth-\nical frameworks andinclude the reasoning for their decisions\nunder the multiple frameworks in their paper submissions and\npublications. If the frameworks lead to the same conclusion,\nthe inclusion of multiple arguments can strengthen the paper’s\nethics section and can serve as part of the growing foundation\nfor ethical thought in the field. If different frameworks lead\ntodifferent conclusions, and the authors proceed with what\nis considered morally right under one framework but morally\nwrong under another, then surfacing those different consid-\nerations and the final thought processes can be particularly\nvaluable. For example, if papers start including analyses under\nmultiple frameworks, then such analyses could become the\nnorm and published analyses could become additional guides\nfor future researchers.\nTo aid in the above, we propose a process that we call ethics\nmodeling . This process builds on the Menlo Report [56] and\nother approaches for evaluating ethics [38] as well as on\nsome approaches to threat modeling. Namely, we suggest\nthat researchers first do a stakeholder analysis to identify\nall stakeholders potentially impacted by the decision, e.g.,\nusing methods from value sensitive design [21]. Then, for\neach stakeholder, we suggest explicitly identifying the assets\nthat might be impacted by the possible decisions. Then, for\neach possible decision, for each stakeholder, and for each\nasset, enumerate the benefits / harms (consequentialist ethics)\nand the rights supported / violated (deontological ethics). The\nbenefits / harms and rights analyses should consider situations\nin which no adversaries manifest and situations in which\nadversaries manifest. We call this process as ethics modeling\nbecause it combines elements of both ethical analyses and\nthreat modeling.\nWe further encourage researchers to become familiar with\nethical frameworks not deeply considered in this work. An\nexample in the context of computer security and victims of in-\ntimate partner violence is care ethics, as considered in Section\n6.2 of Tseng et al. [53].\nFor Program Committees Discussing Submissions. We\nencourage program committees and paper reviewers to be-\ncome familiar with the different ethical frameworks. When\nquestions of ethics arise in the review process, we encourage\nprogram committee discussions to explicitly reference not\njustwhat the discussants believe is morally right and wrong,\nbutwhythey believe that. The latter — the why — can explic-\nitly refer to analyses under one or more ethical frameworks.\nFurther, we encourage reviewers to strive to infer what ethical\nframework or approaches the authors took, if any and if not ex-\nplicitly articulated, and to consider that the authors may have\ncentered a framework or approach that differs from that of\n(at least some of) the reviewers. The authors’ approach might\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    5159have been shaped by an academic environment or culture\ndifferent from the reviewers’ own, for example.\nFor the Community. We encourage the community at large\nto familiarize themselves with different ethical frameworks.\nThose community discussions could leverage the scenarios\nthat we developed over the course of this research. For exam-\nple, prior to reviewing papers, a program committee could,\ntogether, discuss the committee’s perspective on the right de-\ncisions for the scenarios that we present. From preliminary\nconversations with members of our community, we believe\nthat such discussions will not lead to a universal consensus.\nBut we believe that the resulting conversations, and the points\nraised, would be helpful for those community members as\nthey, for example, embark on reviewing papers with possible\nethical concerns.\nAdditionally, we encourage continued community-wide\nconversations around infrastructure support for proactive, pre-\nreseach considerations of ethics and morality beyond what\nis traditionally covered by IRB. For example, the security\ncommunity might draw inspiration from the Ethics and So-\nciety Review Board as implemented by Stanford HAI [8] as\nwell as existing approaches for peer-review prior to the imple-\nmentation of a research method, e.g., [11]. As with research\nefforts and program committee reviews, we believe that such\nevaluations would benefit from considerations under, or at\nleast awareness of, multiple ethical frameworks.\nFor Educators. We encourage educators to include explicit\ndiscussions of ethics and ethical frameworks in their courses\nif they are not already doing so. Our Scenarios A, B, and C,\nby design, do not lead to obvious right and wrong answers.\nAs a result, we have found that our scenarios are particu-\nlarly conducive to conversations in classes. Educators are\nwelcome to use our scenarios in their classes as well. A com-\npanion slide deck is available at https://securityethics.\ncs.washington.edu .\nFor Industry and Government. Although we have scoped\nour work to focus on computer security research, we believe\nthat this work may also be of interest to those in industry,\ngovernment, and other sectors. One concrete suggestion, as\narticulated by an anonymous reviewer and included with per-\nmission, is for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to\nconsider requiring an “Ethical Considerations under Multiple\nFrameworks” section in each Internet-Draft, much like the\npresent requirement of a “Security Considerations” section.\nFor Everyone. Creating ethical norms for computer secu-\nrity research is fundamentally challenging because different\nethical frameworks can lead to different conclusions about\nright and wrong. We believe that a more achievable near-term\ngoal is the creation of extensive sets of case studies (like our\nscenarios) that community members can discuss and learn\nfrom.For Us. Although we are confident that our dilemmas in\nScenarios A, B, and C are true dilemmas (per our criteria\nin Section 3.1, our validation methodology, and extensive\niteration and discussion), this version of our paper does not\nreport concrete data (as doing so is not the goal of this paper).\nOur ongoing work seeks to provide such concrete data across\ncultures and communities. We are additionally preparing other\ncomputer scenario descriptions, in the format of the scenarios\nin this paper, for community consideration. As we create these\nscenarios, we will add them to https://securityethics.\ncs.washington.edu/ .\n7 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we embark on a research collaboration span-\nning (1) ethics / moral philosophy and (2) computer security\nresearch. We develop criteria for computer security-themed\ntrolley problems. We present three such trolley problems (Sce-\nnarios A, B, and C) and then evaluate those trolley problems\nunder today’s main ethical frameworks. Given the findings\nof our research, we reflect and offer considerations for the\ncomputer security research community.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by the U.S. National Science\nFoundation under awards CNS-2205171 and CNS-2206865,\nthe University of Washington Tech Policy Lab (which re-\nceives support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foun-\ndation, the John D. and Catherine T.
