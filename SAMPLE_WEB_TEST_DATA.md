## Test Scenario: Wearable Fitness Tracker Study for Mental Health

Copy and paste the answers below into the web form for each question.

---

### Question 1: Protocol Title
```
Investigating the Impact of Wearable Fitness Trackers on Mental Health and Exercise Habits in College Students with Depression and Anxiety
```

---

### Question 2: Background and Objectives

**2.1 Specific Aims:**
```
This study aims to determine whether continuous use of wearable fitness trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) can improve mental health outcomes and increase physical activity levels in college students diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders. We hypothesize that students using fitness trackers for 12 weeks will show significant improvements in depression scores (PHQ-9), anxiety scores (GAD-7), and weekly exercise minutes compared to a control group.
```

**2.2 Relevant Findings:**
```
Recent research by Martinez et al. (2024) showed that physical activity interventions reduced depression symptoms by 23% in college populations. However, Chen & Williams (2025) found that excessive self-monitoring via wearables increased anxiety in 18% of participants. The potential benefits include improved mood regulation, better sleep quality, and increased social connection through fitness app communities. Risks include obsessive exercise behaviors, privacy concerns with health data collection, and potential anxiety from constant health monitoring.
```

**2.3 Related Studies:**
```
This study builds on our preliminary survey (IRB #2025-0234) of 100 students showing 67% interest in using wearables for mental health management. It also extends the work of Thompson University's IRB #2024-0891 examining fitness apps for stress reduction.
```

---

### Question 3: Data Use
```
Data will be used for:
- Master's thesis (Graduate Student: Sarah Kim, Psychology Department)
- Publication in Journal of American College Health
- Presentation at American Psychological Association (APA) Annual Convention 2026
- University wellness program development
- Grant application to National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
- Anonymous aggregated data shared with campus counseling services for program planning
- De-identified dataset shared with fitness tracker manufacturer for product improvement research
```

---

### Question 4: Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

**4.1 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:**
```
INCLUDED: College students aged 18-25 enrolled full-time
INCLUDED: Diagnosed with depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) or anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 10) within past 6 months
INCLUDED: Currently receiving mental health treatment (therapy and/or medication)
INCLUDED: Own a smartphone compatible with fitness trackers
EXCLUDED: Minors under 18
EXCLUDED: Eating disorder diagnosis (to avoid triggering behaviors)
EXCLUDED: Severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 20) requiring intensive treatment
INCLUDED: Students with physical disabilities (tracker selection accommodates various abilities)
EXCLUDED: Current pregnancy (different activity guidelines apply)
INCLUDED: International students
```

**4.2 Rationale for Exclusion:**
```
Eating disorder patients excluded due to risk that calorie/activity tracking could worsen symptoms. Severely depressed students excluded as they require immediate intensive care beyond this study's scope. Pregnant students excluded due to specialized activity recommendations. Minors excluded to simplify consent procedures.
```

**4.3 Procedures for Determination:**
```
Screening via online Qualtrics survey including validated PHQ-9 and GAD-7 assessments. Medical diagnosis verification through campus health center records (with student consent). Pregnancy status via self-report. Eating disorder screening using SCOFF questionnaire. Mental health treatment status confirmed through counseling center database.
```

---

### Question 5: Number of Participants
```
Total: 120 students
- Intervention group (fitness tracker): 60 students
- Control group (standard care): 60 students

Justification:
Power analysis (α=0.05, β=0.20, effect size d=0.50) indicates 52 participants per group needed to detect clinically meaningful differences in PHQ-9 scores. Recruiting 60 per group accounts for 15% attrition rate common in 12-week mental health studies. Effect size based on Martinez et al. (2024) meta-analysis showing moderate effects of physical activity interventions on depression.
```

  * "Will my therapist know I'm in the study?" (Only if you tell them)
  * "What if I want my friend to join?" (Give them screening survey link)

Private consultation offered: "Would you like to discuss anything one-on-one in separate room?"

12.10 CONSENT CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS:

Challenge: Student feels pressured by friend who's enrolling
Solution: Emphasize individual decision, offer separate consent session away from friend

Challenge: Student eager to enroll immediately without reading consent form
Solution: "Great you're interested! Please take 2 days to review. Quick decisions sometimes lead to regret."

Challenge: Student worried about disappointing research team by declining
Solution: "Our goal is informed decision, not enrollment. Saying no is completely okay and helps us too."

Challenge: Student doesn't understand randomization
Solution: Use coin flip demonstration, dice roll, or random number generator to illustrate concept

Challenge: Student concerned about control group "not getting anything"
Solution: Emphasize delayed tracker, wellness resources, and contribution to science. "Both groups are equally important."

Challenge: Student wants to ensure they get intervention group
Solution: Explain randomization is ethical requirement, can't accommodate preferences, but control group receives delayed benefit

Challenge: Student has literacy difficulties with 8-page consent form
Solution: Audio recording of consent form, one-on-one verbal explanation, simplified language version, extra time

12.11 CONSENT MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE:

IRB oversight:
- Consent forms submitted with initial IRB application
- Any changes require IRB amendment approval
- Annual continuing review includes consent procedure evaluation

PI supervision:
- Dr. Roberts observes first 3 consent sessions by each new consenter
- Random 10% of consent sessions audio recorded (with participant permission) for quality review
- Monthly team meetings to discuss consent challenges and solutions

Participant feedback:
- Exit survey includes consent process questions:
  * "Did you feel pressured to enroll?"
  * "Were risks clearly explained?"
  * "Did you feel you could ask questions?"
  * "Was information provided in understandable language?"
- Feedback used to improve consent procedures

Documentation audits:
- Quarterly review of consent database for completeness
- Check: All required signatures, dates, comprehension assessment documented
- Missing documentation flagged and corrected

Reportable events:
- Any consent irregularity (e.g., unsigned form discovered, incorrect version used) reported to IRB within 5 days
- Corrective action plan implemented

The consent process is designed to ensure participants truly understand what they're agreeing to, feel no pressure, and can make informed voluntary decision about enrollment. Vulnerable population (students with mental health conditions) receives extra protections and careful, compassionate consent procedures.
