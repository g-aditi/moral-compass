**Key Ethical Considerations and Potential IRB Compliance Issues**

The proposed study on the impact of AI-assisted learning tools on student performance in undergraduate computer science courses raises several ethical considerations and potential IRB compliance issues.

1. **Informed Consent**: The protocol does not specify whether students will be informed about the use of AI-assisted learning tools or their potential biases. The IRB should ensure that participants understand how the tools may affect their learning experience (Reference [1], Section 1, Paragraph 2).
2. **Data Protection**: The study involves collecting and analyzing student performance data, which may contain sensitive information. The protocol should outline measures to protect participant confidentiality and data security (Reference [1], Section 3, Paragraph 4).
3. **Equity and Fairness**: AI-assisted learning tools may perpetuate existing biases in the education system if not designed or implemented with fairness and equity in mind. The IRB should review the protocol to ensure that the study does not inadvertently discriminate against certain student groups (Reference [2], Section 5, Paragraph 3).

**Concerns and Strengths**

* **Lack of Clear Measures**: The protocol does not provide clear measures for evaluating the effectiveness of AI-assisted learning tools or their potential impact on student performance. The IRB should request more detailed information on the assessment methods (Reference [1], Section 6, Paragraph 2).
* **Potential for Bias**: The study's reliance on pre-existing AI algorithms may introduce biases into the results. The protocol should discuss strategies for mitigating these biases and ensuring that the tools are designed to promote equity and fairness (Reference [2], Section 4, Paragraph 3).

**Recommendations**

1. Revise the protocol to include informed consent procedures that ensure participants understand how AI-assisted learning tools may affect their learning experience.
2. Conduct a thorough risk-benefit analysis to ensure that the potential benefits of the study outweigh any potential risks or harms to participants.
3. Consult with experts in education, computer science, and ethics to review the protocol and provide guidance on promoting equity and fairness in the use of AI-assisted learning tools.

By addressing these concerns and ensuring compliance with relevant guidelines (References [1] and [2]), the IRB can help ensure that the study is conducted in an ethical and responsible manner.

    Recent meta-analysis by Thompson et al. (2025) showed that AI-assisted learning tools
    improved STEM student performance by 18% on average. However, Davis & Kumar (2024)
    raised concerns about algorithmic bias potentially disadvantaging underrepresented
    groups. Johnson (2024) found that over-reliance on AI tools may reduce critical
    thinking skills. Benefits include personalized learning paths and immediate feedback,
    while risks include privacy concerns with student data and potential widening of
    achievement gaps.

    2.3 Related Studies:
    This study extends IRB #2024-0456 at Stanford University examining AI tutoring systems
    for mathematics education. It also builds on our pilot study (IRB #2025-0012) with
    50 students showing promising preliminary results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IRB COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the provided text, here is a detailed analysis of the key ethical considerations and potential IRB compliance issues:

**Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:**

* The inclusion criteria are well-defined, with specific groups identified as eligible for participation (e.g., ASU undergraduate students aged 18-24, GPA 2.0-4.0, international students, students with learning disabilities, first-generation college students).
* However, the exclusion criteria may raise concerns about potential biases and underrepresentation of certain populations:
	+ Minors under 18 are excluded, which may not be representative of the traditional undergraduate population.
	+ Graduate students are excluded, which may limit the diversity of participants' skill levels.
	+ Students on academic probation are excluded, which may lead to non-representative results if this group is disproportionately affected.

**Rationale for Exclusion:**

* The rationale provided for excluding certain groups (minors under 18, graduate students, and students on academic probation) appears reasonable, as it aims to maintain a homogeneous study population and avoid potential conflicts with existing programs.
* However, the IRB should ensure that these exclusions are not arbitrary and do not unfairly disadvantage specific groups.

**Procedures for Determination:**

* The procedures for determining eligibility appear straightforward, relying on ASU student records systems, registrar databases, student affairs databases, and self-reported data from participants with learning disabilities.
* However, the IRB should verify that these procedures are reliable and accurate, and that participant consent is properly obtained.

**Key Ethical Considerations:**

* **Informed Consent:** The protocol does not provide explicit informed consent procedures for participants with learning disabilities. The IRB should ensure that participants are adequately informed about their rights and responsibilities in the study.
* **Participant Safety:** While the exclusion criteria aim to avoid potential conflicts, students on academic probation may still face difficulties in completing the study. The IRB should consider providing accommodations or support for these students to ensure their safety and well-being.

**Potential IRB Compliance Issues:**

* **Inadequate Participant Selection:** The inclusion/exclusion criteria may lead to biased samples if not carefully considered.
* **Lack of Transparency:** The rationale for excluding certain groups is not explicitly stated, which may raise concerns about the protocol's transparency and fairness.
* **Insufficient Monitoring:** There is no indication that the study will include adequate monitoring or oversight mechanisms to ensure participant safety and well-being.

**Recommendations:**

1. Provide explicit informed consent procedures for participants with learning disabilities.
2. Conduct a thorough review of the inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure they are not biased or unfair.
3. Consider including additional safeguards, such as accommodations or support services, for students on academic probation.
4. Develop and implement adequate monitoring and oversight mechanisms to ensure participant safety and well-being.

QUESTION 6
================================================================================

USER INPUT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Number of Participants: 300 students total
    - 150 in intervention group (AI study tool access)
    - 150 in control group (standard study resources only)

    Justification:
    Power analysis (α=0.05, β=0.20, effect size d=0.35) indicates 135 participants per
    group needed to detect meaningful differences in exam scores. We recruited 150 per
    group to account for 10% attrition rate. Effect size based on Thompson et al. (2025)
    meta-analysis of similar educational technology interventions.

    Sample size adequate for subgroup analyses by: gender, race/ethnicity, first-generation
    status, and learning disability status (minimum 30 participants per subgroup).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IRB COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Key Ethical Considerations:**

1. **Informed Consent**: The study involves 300 students, but only half of them (150) will have access to a new study tool (AI study tool), while the other half (150) will use standard resources only. Will students understand the potential benefits and risks associated with using the AI study tool? Is informed consent adequate for this population?
2. **Vulnerability**: Students who are first-generation, have learning disabilities, or belong to specific racial/ethnic groups may be more vulnerable to biases in the study design or data analysis. How will the IRB ensure that these students' rights are protected and their participation is voluntary?
3. **Power Analysis and Sample Size**: The power analysis indicates that 135 participants per group would be sufficient to detect meaningful differences, but 150 participants were recruited to account for attrition rates. Will this additional sample size affect the study's validity or generalizability?

**Potential IRB Compliance Issues:**

1. **Inadequate Representation**: With only 50% of students participating in each condition, it may be challenging to represent the diversity of the student population accurately.
2. **Biased Study Design**: The AI study tool may not be equally accessible or effective for all students, particularly those with disabilities or from diverse backgrounds. How will the IRB ensure that the study design minimizes biases and maximizes fairness?
3. **Lack of Transparency**: Are the researchers transparent about their methodology, data collection procedures, and potential risks associated with using the AI study tool?

**Concerns and Strengths:**

1. **Strengths**: The power analysis indicates a robust sample size, and the inclusion of subgroup analyses by relevant characteristics (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) is a positive step towards addressing diversity and equity concerns.
2. **Concerns**: The use of AI study tool raises potential concerns about bias, accessibility, and equitable distribution of benefits.

**Actionable Recommendations:**

1. **Enhance Informed Consent**: Revise the informed consent process to ensure that students understand the potential risks and benefits associated with using the AI study tool, particularly for vulnerable populations.
2. **Diversity and Equity Analysis**: Conduct a thorough diversity and equity analysis to identify potential biases in the study design or data analysis.
3. **Regular IRB Review**: Schedule regular IRB review meetings to ensure that the study is progressing according to protocol and addressing any emerging concerns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IRB COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's my analysis of the recruitment personnel, process, materials, and consent procedures for the study:

**Key Ethical Considerations and Potential IRB Compliance Issues**

1. **Informed Consent**: The study requires informed consent from participants, which is a fundamental ethical principle in research (Nuremberg Code, 1947; Helsinki Declaration, 1964). The consent procedure appears to be adequate, with group sessions followed by individual review of the consent form.
2. **Recruitment Methods**: The use of multiple recruitment methods, including email announcements, in-class announcements, flyers, and social media posts, may help reach a wider audience (American Psychological Association, 1973). However, it's essential to ensure that these methods do not disproportionately target vulnerable populations or those who may be less likely to participate.
3. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval**: The protocol appears to have been IRB-approved, which is crucial for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and protecting human subjects.
4. **Data Privacy**: The study's data privacy procedures are not explicitly mentioned in the context documents, but it's essential to ensure that participant data is protected and handled in accordance with relevant regulations (e.g., HIPAA).
5. **Recruitment Personnel Competence**: The use of multiple researchers, including PhD students and undergraduate research assistants, may pose risks if they lack expertise or training in recruitment and informed consent procedures.

**Concerns**

1. **Overreliance on Social Media**: While social media can be an effective recruitment tool, relying solely on this method may limit the study's reach to certain populations.
2. **Lack of Diverse Recruitment Strategies**: The protocol could benefit from additional recruitment strategies targeting underrepresented groups or those who may face barriers to participation (e.g., students with disabilities).
3. **Limited Feedback Mechanism**: There is no clear mechanism for participants to provide feedback on the consent process or study procedures.

**Strengths**

1. **Comprehensive Consent Procedure**: The group and individual consent sessions appear to be well-structured, allowing participants to understand the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits.
2. **Clear Recruitment Materials**: The IRB-approved recruitment materials (e.g., email announcement, flyer) are concise and easy to understand.

**Recommendations**

1. Consider adding additional recruitment strategies targeting underrepresented groups or those who may face barriers to participation.
2. Develop a feedback mechanism for participants to provide input on the consent process or study procedures.
3. Ensure that researchers involved in recruitment and informed consent procedures receive training and support to maintain competence and confidence.

By addressing these concerns and strengths, the protocol can be further optimized to ensure participant well-being and compliance with regulatory requirements.

1. **Informed Consent**: The consent session (30 minutes) may not be sufficient to ensure that participants fully understand the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits. A more detailed informed consent document should be provided.
2. **Age and Maturity**: The study targets undergraduate students, but there is no consideration for potential age-related differences in maturity levels, which could impact their ability to provide informed consent or participate in certain procedures (e.g., coding proficiency test).
3. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval**: Although the study protocol is submitted for IRB approval, the specific requirements and regulations under [1] are not mentioned.
4. **Data Protection and Anonymity**: The use of an AI-powered tool to collect data raises concerns about potential biases in the algorithm and its impact on participant data. Moreover, there is no clear mechanism in place to ensure participant anonymity, which could compromise confidentiality (see [2]).
5. **Dependent Care**: Participants may be required to devote significant time to the study's procedures, potentially impacting their dependent care responsibilities.

**Concerns and Strengths**

1. **Strength**: The use of an AI-powered tool to provide personalized feedback and support can enhance participant engagement and motivation.
2. **Concern**: The study's reliance on a single mobile app for data collection raises concerns about technical issues, app stability, and participant access.
3. **Strength**: The inclusion of a follow-up survey (15 minutes) at 6 weeks after the course ends demonstrates a commitment to assessing long-term outcomes and participant satisfaction.

**Recommendations**

1. Revise informed consent procedures to ensure participants fully understand the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits.
2. Consider including additional safeguards for underage students, such as parental or guardian consent.
3. Consult with an IRB (e.g., [3]) to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and guidelines.
4. Implement measures to protect participant data and maintain anonymity, such as encryption and pseudonymization.
5. Develop a contingency plan to address potential technical issues with the mobile app.

IRB COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the provided text, I have identified several key ethical considerations and potential IRB compliance issues in the protocol:

**Ethical Considerations:**

1. **Informed Consent**: The protocol does not explicitly state how participants will be informed about the research, its purpose, risks, benefits, and alternative uses of their data. [3] It is essential to ensure that participants understand what they are participating in and have given their informed consent.
2. **Compensation**: The compensation structure may be perceived as coercive or exploitative, particularly if participants feel they need the gift cards to participate. [4] The protocol should consider alternative forms of compensation that do not create undue pressure on participants.
3. **Data Protection**: The protocol mentions an encrypted REDCap database for tracking compensation distribution, but it is unclear how participant data will be protected from unauthorized access or breaches. [5]

**Potential IRB Compliance Issues:**

1. **FEDAPa compliance**: The protocol does not explicitly state whether the research complies with the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (FEPAS) regulations. [6] It is essential to review FEPAS guidelines and ensure that the protocol meets all requirements.
2. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight**: The protocol mentions a university IRB, but it is unclear whether the IRB has reviewed and approved the study protocol in its entirety. [7]
3. **Conflict of Interest**: Dr. Maria Santos (PI) and Dr. James Chen (Co-PI) have a conflict of interest due to their affiliation with ASU School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, which may influence their research objectivity. [8]

**Recommendations:**

1. Revise the protocol to include clear informed consent procedures for participants.
2. Consider alternative forms of compensation that are less coercive and exploitative.
3. Enhance data protection measures by implementing additional safeguards against unauthorized access or breaches.
4. Ensure FEPAS compliance by reviewing and updating the protocol to meet all regulatory requirements.
5. Obtain explicit IRB approval for the study protocol, including review and approval from a separate Institutional Review Board (IRB) committee if necessary.

IRB COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Key Ethical Considerations and Potential IRB Compliance Issues**

The provided text outlines a research study involving an AI-powered educational tool, with potential risks to participants in various categories (academic, psychological, privacy, social, and equity). To identify key ethical considerations and potential IRB compliance issues, the following points can be highlighted:

1. **Informed Consent**: Although not explicitly stated, informed consent is crucial for any research study involving human subjects. Participants must be fully aware of the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to the AI tool. The protocol should include clear explanations of how data will be collected, stored, and protected (e.g., [1]§ 46.101).
2. **Data Privacy**: The use of AES-256 encryption for all data is a positive step, but more can be done to ensure data protection. HIPAA-compliant servers are mentioned, which aligns with federal guidelines (e.g., [2]42 CFR Part 2). However, immediate data breach notification protocols and regular security audits are essential to demonstrate accountability.
3. **Algorithmic Bias**: The development team's diversity is a positive aspect, but algorithm bias testing and regular audits are necessary to prevent potential disparities in recommendations (e.g., [1]§ 46.101(c)).
4. **Stigma and Social Comparison**: Providing optional anonymous participation and confidential disclosure of results can help mitigate potential stigmatization effects (e.g., [1]§ 46.103(a)).

**Concerns and Strengths**

* Concern: The lack of clear guidelines for students without reliable internet/devices may lead to an equity issue, where underrepresented groups are disadvantaged.
	+ Actionable step: Loaner laptops and mobile hotspots can be provided to ensure equal access.
* Concern: No specific measures are mentioned to address technical failures or AI recommendations being incorrect, which could impact participant well-being.
	+ Actionable step: Regular system checks and user support can be implemented to minimize these issues.
* Strength: The use of a free technical support hotline for tool-related issues demonstrates a commitment to participants' needs.

**Mitigation Strategies**

The provided mitigation strategies are generally effective in addressing potential risks. However, some suggestions could enhance the protocol:

* Include more detailed information about the development team's diversity and their efforts to address algorithmic bias.
* Provide clear guidelines for students without reliable internet/devices, such as access to alternative resources or assistance with device purchases.
* Regularly review and update the data breach notification protocol to ensure it remains effective.

**Risk Level**

The risk level of this research study is low to moderate due to the educational nature of the research and the consideration of potential equity issues. However, the implementation of measures to address these concerns can further mitigate risks and enhance the overall research integrity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IRB COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Key Ethical Considerations and Potential IRB Compliance Issues**

The study protocol presents several key ethical considerations and potential IRB compliance issues:

1. **Informed Consent**: The consent form appears to be comprehensive, covering the direct benefits to participants, disclaimer of guaranteed academic improvement, and limitations of the tool's effectiveness. However, the consent form should ideally be reviewed and approved by an IRB prior to participant recruitment.
2. **Benefit/Risk Assessment**: While the protocol provides potential benefits to participants, such as access to a valuable AI study tool and research participation experience, the risks are not explicitly stated in the provided text. An IRB would need to evaluate whether the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and that participants understand these risks.
3. **Confidentiality and Data Protection**: The protocol does not explicitly address confidentiality or data protection measures. Participants' personal data, including performance metrics and learning recommendations, may be collected and stored by the researchers. An IRB would need to review the institution's policies on data protection and ensure that participants' data is handled in accordance with federal regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
4. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Oversight**: The protocol mentions that the study will be reviewed by an IRB, but it does not specify whether the IRB has been registered with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP). An IRB must be registered with OHRP before a study can begin.
5. **Compensation and Incentives**: The protocol provides $125 in total compensation for participation, which may be seen as an incentive to participate in research. However, the IRB would need to ensure that this compensation is not coercive or exploitative.

**Concerns**

1. **Lack of transparency**: While the consent form appears comprehensive, there may be additional aspects of the protocol that are not disclosed to participants.
2. **Unclear risk-benefit assessment**: The potential benefits and risks of participation in the study are not explicitly stated in the provided text, which may lead to incomplete informed consent.

**Strengths**

1. **Comprehensive consent form**: The consent form covers key aspects of the protocol, including direct benefits, disclaimer of guaranteed academic improvement, and limitations of the tool's effectiveness.
2. **Clear societal benefits**: The protocol provides clear explanations of how the study will contribute to advancing knowledge in CS education and informing evidence-based educational technology policies.

**Recommendations for IRB Review**

1. Review the consent form to ensure that it adequately covers all aspects of the protocol.
2. Evaluate whether the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and that participants understand these risks.
3. Review the institution's policies on data protection and ensure that participants' data is handled in accordance with federal regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
4. Verify that the IRB has been registered with OHRP before proceeding with participant recruitment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IRB COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Key Ethical Considerations and Potential IRB Compliance Issues**

The protocol appears to prioritize participant privacy and confidentiality, which is commendable. However, several potential issues and considerations arise:

1. **Inadequate Data De-identification**: The protocol uses random IDs (COMP001-COMP300) for participants, but does not provide sufficient details on how these IDs are generated or validated. This might lead to concerns about the effectiveness of de-identification procedures.
2. **Lack of Standardized Data Dictionary**: Although a data dictionary and codebook are included with shared datasets, it is unclear whether they adhere to standardized guidelines (e.g., [1]). This might result in inconsistent interpretations of data across different stakeholders.
3. **Insufficient Security Measures for App Vendor Partnerships**: The protocol relies on Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with the app vendor and external analysts, but does not provide sufficient details on how these agreements address security requirements, breach notification, or destruction timelines.
4. **Potential Inadequate FERPA Compliance**: Although the protocol attempts to obtain course enrollment data from the registrar with student authorization in the consent form, it is unclear whether this meets the standards outlined in [2].
5. **Unclear Timeline for Data Sharing and Destruction**: The protocol does not specify a clear timeline for sharing de-identified data with the NSF Public Access Repository or destroying identifiable data after 7 years.

**Concerns and Strengths**

Strengths:

* The protocol emphasizes participant privacy and confidentiality, which is essential for maintaining trust.
* It uses encryption and secure storage methods to protect sensitive data.

Concerns:

* Inadequate de-identification procedures might lead to concerns about the effectiveness of de-identification methods.
* Insufficient security measures for app vendor partnerships raise questions about the robustness of these agreements.

**Actionable Recommendations**

1. **Develop a more comprehensive data de-identification plan**, including standardized procedures and validation techniques, to ensure that participant data is adequately protected.
2. **Adopt standardized guidelines** for data dictionaries and codebooks to ensure consistency across different stakeholders.
3. **Enhance security measures** for app vendor partnerships by incorporating additional provisions into BAAs, such as enhanced encryption protocols or more stringent breach notification requirements.
4. **Verify FERPA compliance** by consulting with the U.S. Department of Education's Family Policy Compliance Office and ensuring that all data requests meet the necessary standards.
5. **Establish a clear timeline for data sharing and destruction**, including specific dates for sharing de-identified data and destroying identifiable data after 7 years.

By addressing these concerns and implementing actionable recommendations, the protocol can further strengthen its commitment to participant privacy and confidentiality while maintaining IRB compliance.

IRB COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Key Ethical Considerations:**

1. **Informed Consent**: The consent process appears to be comprehensive, covering all necessary aspects of the study, including potential risks and benefits, time commitment, and data sharing plans.
2. **Voluntary Participation**: The protocol ensures that participants can withdraw at any time without penalty or repercussions.
3. **Data Security and Privacy**: Measures are in place to protect participant data, such as encryption and secure storage.

**Potential IRB Compliance Issues:**

1. **Student Disabilitiy Accommodations**: While the protocol mentions accommodations for students with disabilities (e.g., extended review time, sign language interpreter), it is unclear whether these provisions would be sufficient to meet federal regulations (e.g., 45 CFR 97.122).
2. **Non-English Speakers**: The use of English-only consent forms and CSE courses taught in English may pose a barrier for non-English speakers.
3. **Funding Source Disclosure**: Although the protocol mentions funding source (National Science Foundation), it is unclear whether this disclosure complies with federal regulations regarding commercial support.

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive Consent Process**: The protocol outlines a detailed and structured consent process, which can help ensure that participants understand the study's purpose, risks, and benefits.
2. **Regular Reminders of Voluntary Participation**: The mid-study check-in and re-affirmation of consent procedures can help maintain participant awareness of their voluntary participation.

**Concerns:**

1. **Lack of Translation Options**: The absence of translation options for non-English speakers may limit accessibility and compliance with federal regulations.
2. **Insufficient Accommodations for Non-English Speakers**: While accommodations are mentioned, it is unclear whether these provisions would be sufficient to meet federal regulations.

**Recommendations:**

1. Ensure that the consent form is translated into accessible formats (e.g., screen reader compatible) to comply with federal regulations regarding non-English speakers.
2. Verify that student disability accommodations meet federal regulations and provide adequate support for participants with disabilities.
3. Confirm that the funding source disclosure complies with federal regulations regarding commercial support.
